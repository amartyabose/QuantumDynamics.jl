  abstract = {Molecular chirality has traditionally been viewed as a binary property where a molecule is classified as either chiral or achiral, yet in recent decades, mathematical methods for quantifying chirality have been explored. Here, we use toy molecular systems to systematically compare the performance of two state-of-the-art chirality measures: (1) the Continuous Chirality Measure (CCM) and (2) the Chirality Characteristic ({$\chi$}). We find that both methods exhibit qualitatively similar behavior when applied to simple molecular systems such as a four-site molecule or the polymer double-helix, but we show that the CCM may be more suitable for evaluating the chirality of arbitrary molecules or abstract structures such as normal vibrational modes. We discuss a range of considerations for applying these methods to molecular systems in general, and we provide links to user-friendly codes for both methods. We aim for this paper to serve as a concise resource for scientists attempting to familiarize themselves with these chirality measures or attempting to implement chirality measures in their own work.},

  abstract = {A simple electrostatic method for the calculation of optical transition energies of pigments in protein environments is presented and applied to the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex of Prosthecochloris aestuarii and Chlorobium tepidum. The method, for the first time, allows us to reach agreement between experimental optical spectra and calculations based on transition energies of pigments that are calculated in large part independently, rather than fitted to the spectra. In this way it becomes possible to understand the molecular mechanism allowing the protein to trigger excitation energy transfer reactions. The relative shift in excitation energies of the seven bacteriochlorophyll-a pigments of the FMO complex of P. aestuarii and C. tepidum are obtained from calculations of electrochromic shifts due to charged amino acids, assuming a standard protonation pattern of the protein, and by taking into account the three different ligand types of the pigments. The calculations provide an explanation of some of the earlier results for the transition energies obtained from fits of optical spectra. In addition, those earlier fits are verified here by using a more advanced theory of optical spectra, a genetic algorithm, and excitonic couplings obtained from electrostatic calculations that take into account the influence of the dielectric protein environment. The two independent calculations of site energies strongly favor one of the two possible orientations of the FMO trimer relative to the photosynthetic membrane, which were identified by electron microscopic studies and linear dichroism experiments. Efficient transfer of excitation energy to the reaction center requires bacteriochlorophylls 3 and 4 to be the linker pigments. The temporal and spatial transfer of excitation energy through the FMO complex is calculated to proceed along two branches, with transfer times that differ by an order of magnitude.},

  abstract = {The Born-Oppenheimer approximation constitutes a cornerstone of our understanding of molecules and their reactivity, partly because it introduces a somewhat simplified representation of the molecular wavefunction. However, when a molecule absorbs light containing enough energy to trigger an electronic transition, the simplistic nature of the molecular wavefunction offered by the Born-Oppenheimer approximation breaks down as a result of the now non-negligible coupling between nuclear and electronic motion, often coined nonadiabatic couplings. Hence, the description of nonadiabatic processes implies a change in our representation of the molecular wavefunction, leading eventually to the design of new theoretical tools to describe the fate of an electronically-excited molecule. This Overview focuses on this quantity?the total molecular wavefunction?and the different approaches proposed to describe theoretically this complicated object in non-Born-Oppenheimer conditions, namely the Born-Huang and Exact-Factorization representations. The way each representation depicts the appearance of nonadiabatic effects is then revealed by using a model of a coupled proton?electron transfer reaction. Applying approximations to the formally exact equations of motion obtained within each representation leads to the derivation, or proposition, of different strategies to simulate the nonadiabatic dynamics of molecules. Approaches like quantum dynamics with fixed and time-dependent grids, traveling basis functions, or mixed quantum/classical like surface hopping, Ehrenfest dynamics, or coupled-trajectory schemes are described in this Overview.

Yet predicting CP optical and electronic properties remains a serious challenge, driven by the computational difficulty of treating large, electronically coupled molecular pigments embedded in a dynamically structured protein environment. To address this challenge, we introduce here an analysis tool called PigmentHunter, which automates the process of preparing CP structures for molecular dynamics (MD), running short MD simulations on the nanoHUB.org science gateway, and then using electrostatic and steric analysis routines to predict optical absorption, fluorescence, and circular dichroism spectra within a Frenkel exciton model. Inter-pigment couplings are evaluated using point-dipole or transition-charge coupling models, while site energies can be estimated using both electrostatic and ring-deformation approaches. The package is built in a Jupyter Notebook environment, with a point-and-click interface that can be used either to manually prepare individual structures or to batch-process many structures at once. We illustrate PigmentHunter's capabilities with example simulations on spectral line shapes in the light harvesting 2 complex, site energies in the Fenna--Matthews--Olson protein, and ring deformation in photosystems I and II.},

However, when statistical noise is present, the direct procedure produces more accurate results. The direct procedure is efficient and easy to implement.},

The division into bath states and primary states is completely general in principle, though in practice, physical considerations will guide the choice of partitioning. The exact influence functional is nonlocal in time and very complicated in form. We argue, however, by a variational calculation that a simplified approximate functional can be constructed which is very accurate. Unlike the standard Gaussian influence functionals which are inapplicable for processes involving the large amplitude fluctuations of charge transfer and fermionic exchange, the influence functionals described herein are appropriate for models of these processes.},

These new methods give very close agreement with one another, and the Te PIGS method has recently yielded excellent agreement with experimentally measured vibrational spectra for liquid water, ice, and the liquid-air interface.

The GQME expresses correlation functions in terms of a non-Markovian equation of motion, involving memory kernels that are typically fast-decaying and can therefore be computed by short-time quasiclassical trajectories. In this paper, we study the approximate solution of the GQME, obtained by calculating the kernels with two methods: Ehrenfest mean-field theory and spin-mapping. We test the approaches on a range of spin--boson models with increasing energy bias between the two electronic levels and place a particular focus on the long-time limits of the populations. We find that the accuracy of the predictions of the GQME depends strongly on the specific technique used to calculate the kernels. In particular, spin-mapping outperforms Ehrenfest for all the systems studied. The problem of unphysical negative electronic populations affecting spin-mapping is resolved by coupling the method with the master equation. Conversely, Ehrenfest in conjunction with the GQME can predict negative populations, despite the fact that the populations calculated from direct dynamics are positive definite.},

Focusing on the central embedded dimer, the Coulomb coupling for this J-aggregate is determined by means of the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to be -514 cm--1. Exciton vibrational coupling is treated within the shifted oscillator model from which five strongly coupled modes per monomer are selected for inclusion into a minimal dynamic model. Performing wave packet propagations for a model employing up to 7 electronic states and 30 vibrational modes using the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree method, aggregate absorption spectra are obtained and compared to experiment.},

  abstract = {An accurate determination of the electron correlation energy is an essential prerequisite for describing the structure, stability, and function in a wide variety of systems. Therefore, the development of efficient approaches for the calculation of the correlation energy (and hence the dispersion energy as well) is essential and such methods can be coupled with many density-functional approximations, local methods for the electron correlation energy, and even interatomic force fields. In this work, we build upon the previously developed many-body dispersion (MBD) framework, which is intimately linked to the random-phase approximation for the correlation energy. We separate the correlation energy into short-range contributions that are modeled by semi-local functionals and long-range contributions that are calculated by mapping the complex all-electron problem onto a set of atomic response functions coupled in the dipole approximation. We propose an effective range-separation of the coupling between the atomic response functions that extends the already broad applicability of the MBD method to non-metallic materials with highly anisotropic responses, such as layered nanostructures. Application to a variety of high-quality benchmark datasets illustrates the accuracy and applicability of the improved MBD approach, which offers the prospect of first-principles modeling of large structurally complex systems with an accurate description of the long-range correlation energy.},

  abstract = {In the molecular dynamics simulation method for fluids, the equations of motion for a collection of particles in a fixed volume are solved numerically. The energy, volume, and number of particles are constant for a particular simulation, and it is assumed that time averages of properties of the simulated fluid are equal to microcanonical ensemble averages of the same properties. In some situations, it is desirable to perform simulations of a fluid for particular values of temperature and/or pressure or under conditions in which the energy and volume of the fluid can fluctuate. This paper proposes and discusses three methods for performing molecular dynamics simulations under conditions of constant temperature and/or pressure, rather than constant energy and volume. For these three methods, it is shown that time averages of properties of the simulated fluid are equal to averages over the isoenthalpic--isobaric, canonical, and isothermal--isobaric ensembles. Each method is a way of describing the dynamics of a certain number of particles in a volume element of a fluid while taking into account the influence of surrounding particles in changing the energy and/or density of the simulated volume element. The influence of the surroundings is taken into account without introducing unwanted surface effects. Examples of situations where these methods may be useful are discussed.},

In this review, we discuss an important group of MLPs relying on artificial neural networks to establish a mapping from the atomic structure to the potential energy. In spite of this common feature, there are important conceptual differences among MLPs, which concern the dimensionality of the systems, the inclusion of long-range electrostatic interactions, global phenomena like nonlocal charge transfer, and the type of descriptor used to represent the atomic structure, which can be either predefined or learnable.

Our model provides unambiguous interpretation of previous photoelectron studies, reproducing the binding energies and photoelectron images for bare uracil and a single isomer of the U{$\bullet$}(H2O)1 cluster.

Here we report the observation of de Broglie wave interference of C60 molecules by diffraction at a material absorption grating. This molecule is the most massive and complex object in which wave behaviour has been observed. Of particular interest is the fact that C60 is almost a classical body, because of its many excited internal degrees of freedom and their possible couplings to the environment. Such couplings are essential for the appearance of decoherence, suggesting that interference experiments with large molecules should facilitate detailed studies of this process.},

By exploiting the connection between configuration interaction and CC through cluster analysis, the higher-order T3 and T4 terms obtained from ACI are used to augment the T1 and T2 amplitude equations from traditional CC. These higher-order contributions are kept frozen during the CC iterations and do not contribute to an increased cost with respect to coupled cluster including the single and double excitations (CCSD). We have benchmarked this method on three closed-shell systems: beryllium dimer, carbonyl oxide, and cyclobutadiene, with good results compared to other corrected CC methods. In all cases, the inclusion of these external corrections improved upon the ``gold standard'' CCSD(T) results, indicating that ACI-CCSD(T) can be used to assess strong correlation effects in a system and as an inexpensive starting point for more complex external corrections.},

Their strengths include good electric transport properties in spite of the disorder inherent in them. Motivated by this observation, we analyze the effects of disorder on the energy eigenstates of a tight-binding model of these materials. In particular, we analyze the spatial extension of the energy eigenstates, which is quantified by the inverse participation ratio. This parameter exhibits a tendency, and possibly a phase transition, to localization as the on-site energy disorder strength is increased. However, we argue that the disorder in the lead halide perovskites corresponds to a point in the regime of highly delocalized states. Our results also suggest that the electronic states of mixed-halide materials tend to be more localized than those of pure materials, which suggests a weaker tendency to form extended bonding states in the mixed-halide materials and is therefore not favourable for halide mixing.},

  abstract = {Quantum simulators promise to offer new insights into strongly correlated matter beyond what is accessible by means of classical computers. We propose dynamical quantum simulators (DQSs) as a method to simulate dynamical structure factors (DSFs) for system sizes considerably larger than what classical simulations can compute and provide complexity-theoretic evidence that they cannot be classically efficiently computed. Based on state-of-the-art experimental setups, we show how results from DQSs can be directly compared to experiments exploring properties of quantum materials. At the same time, we explore long-ranged spin systems: In particular, we show that the DSFs in DQSs can exhibit the signatures of excitation confinement in long-ranged models for which a comprehensive understanding is lacking.The dynamical structure factor is one of the experimental quantities crucial in scrutinizing the validity of the microscopic description of strongly correlated systems. However, despite its long-standing importance, it is exceedingly difficult in generic cases to numerically calculate it, ensuring that the necessary approximations involved yield a correct result. Acknowledging this practical difficulty, we discuss in what way results on the hardness of classically tracking time evolution under local Hamiltonians are precisely inherited by dynamical structure factors and, hence, offer in the same way the potential computational capabilities that dynamical quantum simulators do: We argue that practically accessible variants of the dynamical structure factors are bounded-error quantum polynomial time (BQP)-hard for general local Hamiltonians. Complementing these conceptual insights, we improve upon a novel, readily available measurement setup allowing for the determination of the dynamical structure factor in different architectures, including arrays of ultra-cold atoms, trapped ions, Rydberg atoms, and superconducting qubits. Our results suggest that quantum simulations employing near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices should allow for the observation of features of dynamical structure factors of correlated quantum matter in the presence of experimental imperfections, for larger system sizes than what is achievable by classical simulation.All study data are included in the article and supporting information.},

This perspective discusses the major features of DMRG, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses also in comparison with other novel approaches. The method is presented following its historical development, starting from its original formulation up to its most recent applications.

The implementation shares the same general framework of our previous time-independent (TI) model, thus allowing an effective integration between both approaches with the consequent enhancement of their respective strengths (e.g., spectrum completeness and straightforward account of temperature effects for the TD route versus band resolution and assignment for the TI route) using a single set of starting data. Implementation of both models in the same general computer program allows comprehensive studies using several levels of electronic structure description together with effective account of environmental effects by atomistic and/or continuum models of different sophistication. A few medium-size molecules (furan, phenyl radical, anthracene, dimethyloxirane, coumarin 339) have been studied in order to fully validate the approach.},

It has been shown previously that, for a single excited state, the averaged classical dynamics approach to calculate the linear and nonlinear spectroscopy can be derived using the MQCL formalism. This work focuses on problems involving multiple coupled excited state surfaces, such as in molecular aggregates and in the cases of coupled electronic states. A new equation of motion to calculate the dipole-dipole correlation functions within the MQCL formalism is first presented. Two approximate methods are then proposed to solve the resulted equations of motion. The first approximation results in a mean field approach, where the nuclear dynamics is governed by averaged forces depending on the instantaneous electronic states. A modification to the mean field approach based on first order moment expansion is also proposed. Numerical examples including calculation of the absorption spectra of Frenkel exciton models of molecular aggregates, and the pyrazine molecule are presented.},

We first simulate the isotropic pump--probe signal and anisotropy decay of the Fenna--Matthews--Olson (FMO) complex using a model with only electronic coherence at low temperature and obtain the same coherence time as in the previous experiment. Then, three model dimer systems with different prespecified quantum coherence are simulated, and the results show that their different spectral characteristics can be used to determine the type of coherence during the spectral process. Finally, we simulate model systems with different electronic-vibrational couplings and reveal the condition in which long time vibronic coherence can be observed in systems like the FMO complex.},

We discuss the non-Hermitian skin effect and the notion of the generalized Brillouin zone, which allows restoring the bulk-boundary correspondence. Using concrete examples, we examine the role of disorder, describe the Floquet engineering, present the linear response framework, and analyze the Hall transport properties of non-Hermitian topological systems.

The main idea is to identify a trajectory-specific reference Hamiltonian that captures the dominant effects of the classical ``solvent'' degrees of freedom on the dynamics of the quantum ``system''. This time-dependent reference is used to construct a system propagator that is valid for large time increments. Residual ``quantum memory'' interactions are included via the path integral representation of the density matrix, which converges with large time steps. Two physically motivated reference schemes are considered. The first involves the dynamics of the solvent unperturbed by the system, which forms the basis for the ``classical path'' approximation. The second is based on solvent trajectories determined self-consistently with the evolution of the system, according to the time-dependent self-consistent field or Ehrenfest model. Application to dissipative two-level systems indicates that both reference schemes allow a substantial increase of the path integral time step, leading to rapid convergence of the path sum. In addition, the time-dependent reference propagators automatically weigh state-to-state coupling against solvent reorganization in the determination of transition probabilities, further enhancing the convergence of the path integral.},

  abstract = {Abstract This review covers a family of atomistic, mostly quantum chemistry (QC) based semiempirical methods for the fast and reasonably accurate description of large molecules in gas and condensed phase. The theory is derived from a density functional (DFT) perturbation expansion of the electron density in fluctuation terms to various orders similar to the original density functional tight binding model. The term ?eXtended? in their name (xTB) emphasizes the parameter availability for almost the entire periodic table of elements (Z?{$\leq$}?86) and improvements of the underlying theory regarding, for example, the atomic orbital basis set, the level of multipole approximation and the treatment of the important electrostatic and dispersion interactions. A common feature of most members is their consistent parameterization on accurate gas phase theoretical reference data for geometries, vibrational frequencies and noncovalent interactions, which are the primary properties of interest in typical applications to systems composed of up to a few thousand atoms. Further specialized versions were developed for the description of electronic spectra and corresponding response properties. Besides a provided common theoretical background with some important implementation details in the efficient and free xtb program, various benchmarks for structural and thermochemical properties including (transition-)metal systems are discussed. The review is completed by recent extensions of the model to the force-field (FF) level as well as its application to solids under periodic boundary conditions. The general applicability together with the excellent cost-accuracy ratio and the high robustness make the xTB family of methods very attractive for various fields of computer-aided chemical research.

  abstract = {An extended semiempirical tight-binding model is presented, which is primarily designed for the fast calculation of structures and noncovalent interaction energies for molecular systems with roughly 1000 atoms. The essential novelty in this so-called GFN2-xTB method is the inclusion of anisotropic second order density fluctuation effects via short-range damped interactions of cumulative atomic multipole moments. Without noticeable increase in the computational demands, this results in a less empirical and overall more physically sound method, which does not require any classical halogen or hydrogen bonding corrections and which relies solely on global and element-specific parameters (available up to radon, Z = 86). Moreover, the atomic partial charge dependent D4 London dispersion model is incorporated self-consistently, which can be naturally obtained in a tight-binding picture from second order density fluctuations. Fully analytical and numerically precise gradients (nuclear forces) are implemented. The accuracy of the method is benchmarked for a wide variety of systems and compared with other semiempirical methods. Along with excellent performance for the ``target'' properties, we also find lower errors for ``off-target'' properties such as barrier heights and molecular dipole moments. High computational efficiency along with the improved physics compared to its precursor GFN-xTB makes this method well-suited to explore the conformational space of molecular systems. Significant improvements are furthermore observed for various benchmark sets, which are prototypical for biomolecular systems in aqueous solution.},

Molecules that enable singlet fission have triplet state energy at least half of the bright singlet state energy. This stringent energy criteria have challenged chemists to device new molecular and supramolecular design principles to modulate the singlet--triplet energy gap and build singlet fission systems from a wide range of organic chromophores. Herein, we report for the first time intramolecular singlet fission in the seminal naphthalenediimide (NDI) scaffold constrained in a push--pull cyclophane architecture, while individually the NDI chromophore does not satisfy the energy criterion. The challenging synthesis of this highly contorted push--pull cyclophane is possible from the preorganized pincer-like precursor. The special architecture establishes the shortest co-facial NDI{$\cdots$}NDI contacts (3.084 {\AA}) realized to date. Using broadband femtosecond transient absorption, we find that the correlated T--T pair forms rapidly within 380 fs of photoexcitation. Electronic structure calculations at the level of state-averaged CASSCF (ne,mo)/XMCQDPT2 support the existence of the multi-excitonic T--T pair state, thereby confirming the first example of singlet exciton fission in a NDI scaffold.},

It is based on the hypothesis that the time evolution of a wave packet through a potential-energy branching region can be approximated by an ensemble of independent semiclassical trajectories stochastically distributed among the branched surfaces. As it was proposed about 40 years ago, the TSH methodology has become one of the main tools for nonadiabatic dynamics propagation in molecular physics and chemistry. One reason for this success lies on its intuitive conceptual background allied to its high computational efficiency when compared to full quantum mechanical propagation. In this work, the TSH method is reviewed and applications from different fields are surveyed. ? 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

In this work, we propose a two-terminal cold-atom simulator to study that interaction. The proposed quantum simulator consists of strongly interacting atoms that occupy two temperature reservoirs connected by a one-dimensional link. First, we argue that the dynamics in the link can be described using an inhomogeneous Heisenberg spin chain whose couplings are defined by the local temperature. Second, we show the existence of a spin current in a system with a temperature difference by studying the dynamics that follows the spin-flip of an atom in the link. A temperature gradient accelerates the impurity in one direction more than in the other, leading to an overall spin current similar to the spin Seebeck effect.},

  abstract = {The attraction density functional theory (DFT) has for electronic structure theory is that it is easier to do computationally than ab initio, correlated wavefunction methods, due to its effective one-particle structure. On the contrary, ab initio theorists insist on the ability to converge to the right answer in appropriate limits, but this requires a treatment of the reduced two-particle density matrix. DFT avoids that by appealing to an ``existence'' theorem (not a constructive one) that all its effects are subsummed into a DFT functional of the one-particle density. However, the existence of thousands of DFT functionals emphasizes that there is no satisfactory way to systematically improve the Kohn-Sham (KS) version as most changes in parameterization or formulation seldom lead to a new functional that is genuinely better than others. Some researchers in the DFT community try to address this issue by imposing conditions rigorously derived from exact DFT considerations, but to date, no one has shown how this route will ever lead to converged results even for the ground state, much less for all the other electronic states obtained from time-dependent DFT that are critically important for chemistry. On the contrary, coupled-cluster (CC) theory and its equation-of-motion extensions provide rigorous results for both that KS-DFT methods are attempting to emulate. How to use them and their exact formal properties to tie CC theory to an effective one-particle form is the target of this perspective. This route addresses the devil's triangle of KS-DFT problems: the one-particle spectrum, self-interaction, and the integer discontinuity.},

The structure of thermodynamic Green's functions is outlined and the method for solving for them at finite temperature is fully discussed. The analytic structure of the phonon Green's function is then considered. This function is shown to be bounded and invertible everywhere off the real axis; a spectral form is derived for its inverse. The symmetries imposed by the point group of the crystal are then discussed. Assuming small ionic oscillations, we find the inverse of the phonon Green's function as a linear function of the electronic contribution to the dielectric response function of the metal. This dielectric function is shown to be simply related to the longitudinal part of the conductivity tensor that gives the response of the electrons to the effective electric field in the metal. The assumption of translational invariance then leads to an explicit expression for the phonon Green's function in terms of this conductivity. The deformations in the lattice induced by an arbitrarily time varying external force are calculated in terms of the retarded phonon Green's function. In the static long wavelength limit the phonon Green's function yields the macroscopic elastic constants of the crystal. Their relation to the conductivity is exhibited, and several elastic constants are estimated. We also see that the complete phonon spectrum and the lifetimes of the phonon states may be calculated from this Green's function. A relation between the long wavelength acoustic attenuation in metals and the de conductivity is derived, which is in good agreement with recent experiments. Furthermore, the ions in a metal are shown to have a high-frequency oscillation along with the electrons, at essentially the electron plasma frequency.},

The formal derivation, numerical implementation, and performance of the method are detailed. As demonstrated by example applications, MCTDH may perform very efficiently, especially when there are many (typically four to twelve, say) degrees of freedom. The largest system treated with MCTDH to date is the pyrazine molecule, where all 24 (!) vibrational modes were accounted for. The particular representation of the MCTDH wavefunction requires special techniques for generating an initial wavepacket and for analysing the propagated wavefunction. These techniques are discussed. The full efficiency of the MCTDH method is only realised if the Hamiltonian can be written as a sum of products of one-dimensional operators. The kinetic energy operator and many model potential functions already have this required structure. For other potential functions, we describe an efficient algorithm for determining optimal fits of product form. An alternative to the product representation, the correlation discrete variable representation (CDVR) method, is also briefly discussed.},

Here, we explore the applicability and limitations of the recently proposed single-Hessian thawed Gaussian approximation for the simulation of spectra of systems with double-well potentials, including 1,2,4,5-tetrafluorobenzene, ammonia, phosphine, and arsine. This semiclassical wavepacket approach is shown to be more robust and to provide more accurate spectra than the conventional harmonic approximation. Specifically, we identify two cases in which the Gaussian wavepacket method is especially useful due to the breakdown of the harmonic approximation: (i) when the nuclear wavepacket is initially at the top of the potential barrier but delocalized over both wells, e.g., along a low-frequency mode, and (ii) when the wavepacket has enough energy to classically go over the low potential energy barrier connecting the two wells. The method is efficient and requires only a single classical ab initio molecular dynamics trajectory, in addition to the data required to compute the harmonic spectra. We also present an improved algorithm for computing the wavepacket autocorrelation function, which guarantees that the evaluated correlation function is continuous for arbitrary size of the time step.},

  abstract = {Accurate description of finite-temperature vibrational dynamics is indispensable in the computation of two-dimensional electronic spectra. Such simulations are often based on the density matrix evolution, statistical averaging of initial vibrational states, or approximate classical or semiclassical limits. While many practical approaches exist, they are often of limited accuracy and difficult to interpret. Here, we use the concept of thermo-field dynamics to derive an exact finite-temperature expression that lends itself to an intuitive wavepacket-based interpretation. Furthermore, an efficient method for computing finite-temperature two-dimensional spectra is obtained by combining the exact thermo-field dynamics approach with the thawed Gaussian approximation for the wavepacket dynamics, which is exact for any displaced, distorted, and Duschinsky-rotated harmonic potential but also accounts partially for anharmonicity effects in general potentials. Using this new method, we directly relate a symmetry breaking of the two-dimensional signal to the deviation from the conventional Brownian oscillator picture.},

Patoz et al., J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 9, 2367 (2018)], which accounts for anharmonicity, mode--mode coupling, and Herzberg--Teller effects. Here, we generalize this method in order to evaluate spectra at non-zero temperature. In line with thermo-field dynamics, we transform the von Neumann evolution of the coherence component of the density matrix to the Schr{\"o}dinger evolution of a wavefunction in an augmented space with twice as many degrees of freedom. Due to the efficiency of the extended thawed Gaussian approximation, this increase in the number of coordinates results in nearly no additional computational cost. More specifically, compared to the original, zero-temperature approach, the finite-temperature method requires no additional ab initio electronic structure calculations. At the same time, the new approach allows for a clear distinction among finite-temperature, anharmonicity, and Herzberg--Teller effects on spectra. We show, on a model Morse system, the advantages of the finite-temperature thawed Gaussian approximation over the commonly used global harmonic methods and apply it to evaluate the symmetry-forbidden absorption spectrum of benzene, where all of the aforementioned effects contribute.},

Application of this ab initio ``three thawed Gaussians approximation''to vibrationally resolved electronic spectra of the phenyl radical and benzene shows a clear improvement over the global harmonic and Condon approximations. The orientational averaging of spectra, the relation between the gradient of the transition dipole moment and nonadiabatic coupling vectors, and the details of the extended and three thawed Gaussians approximation are discussed.},

Previous applications of the FMS method have emphasized the modeling of nonadiabatic effects. Here, a new computational algorithm that accounts for tunneling effects is introduced and tested against exact solution of the Schr{\"o}dinger equation for two multi-dimensional model problems. The algorithm first identifies the tunneling events and then determines the initial conditions for the newly spawned basis functions.

To express the Hermiticity of a Hamiltonian, one writes H?=?H ?, where the symbol ? denotes the usual Dirac Hermitian conjugation; that is, transpose and complex conjugate. In the past few years it has been recognized that the requirement of Hermiticity, which is often stated as an axiom of quantum mechanics, may be replaced by the less mathematical and more physical requirement of space???time reflection symmetry (?? symmetry) without losing any of the essential physical features of quantum mechanics. Theories defined by non-Hermitian ??-symmetric Hamiltonians exhibit strange and unexpected properties at the classical as well as at the quantum level. This paper explains how the requirement of Hermiticity can be evaded and discusses the properties of some non-Hermitian ??-symmetric quantum theories.},

A standard axiom of quantum mechanics requires that H be Hermitian because Hermiticity guarantees that the energy spectrum is real and that time evolution is unitary (probability-preserving). This paper describes an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics in which the mathematical axiom of Hermiticity (transpose +complex conjugate) is replaced by the physically transparent condition of space--time reflection ( ) symmetry. If H has an unbroken   symmetry, then the spectrum is real. Examples of  -symmetric non-Hermitian quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians are   and  . Amazingly, the energy levels of these Hamiltonians are all real and positive! Does a  -symmetric Hamiltonian H specify a physical quantum theory in which the norms of states are positive and time evolution is unitary? The answer is that if H has an unbroken   symmetry, then it has another symmetry represented by a linear operator  . In terms of  , one can construct a time-independent inner product with a positive-definite norm. Thus,  -symmetric Hamiltonians describe a new class of complex quantum theories having positive probabilities and unitary time evolution. The Lee model provides an excellent example of a  -symmetric Hamiltonian. The renormalized Lee-model Hamiltonian has a negative-norm `ghost' state because renormalization causes the Hamiltonian to become non-Hermitian. For the past 50 years there have been many attempts to find a physical interpretation for the ghost, but all such attempts failed. The correct interpretation of the ghost is simply that the non-Hermitian Lee-model Hamiltonian is  -symmetric. The   operator for the Lee model is calculated exactly and in closed form and the ghost is shown to be a physical state having a positive norm. The ideas of   symmetry are illustrated by using many quantum-mechanical and quantum-field-theoretic models.},

However, the Hamiltonian H = p2 + ix3, which is obviously not Dirac Hermitian, has a positive real discrete spectrum and generates unitary time evolution, and thus it defines a fully consistent and physical quantum theory. Evidently, the axiom of Dirac Hermiticity is too restrictive. While H = p2 + ix3 is not Dirac Hermitian, it is PT symmetric; that is, invariant under combined parity P (space reflection) and time reversal T. The quantum mechanics defined by a PT-symmetric Hamiltonian is a complex generalization of ordinary quantum mechanics. When quantum mechanics is extended into the complex domain, new kinds of theories having strange and remarkable properties emerge. In the past few years, some of these properties have been verified in laboratory experiments. A particularly interesting PT-symmetric Hamiltonian is H = p2 - x4, which contains an upside-down potential. This potential is discussed in detail, and it is explained in intuitive as well as in rigorous terms why the energy levels of this potential are real, positive, and discrete. Applications of PT-symmetry in quantum field theory are also discussed.},

Among them are thermostatted ring-polymer molecular dynamics (TRPMD), centroid molecular dynamics (CMD), quasi-centroid molecular dynamics (QCMD), and the linearised semi-classical initial value representation (LSC-IVR). Here we make a systematic comparison of these methods by calculating the infrared spectrum of water in the gas phase, and in the liquid and ice phases (using the q-TIP4P/F model potential). Some of these results are taken from previous work, and some of them are new (including the LSC-IVR calculations for ice, and extensions of all the spectra into the near-infrared region dominated by overtone and combination bands). Our results suggest that QCMD is the best method for reproducing fundamental transitions in the spectrum, and that LSC-IVR gives the best overall description of the spectrum (albeit with large errors in the bend fundamental band caused by zero-point-energy leakage). The TRPMD method gives damped spectra that line up with the QCMD spectra, and is by far the cheapest method.},

  abstract = {There has been substantial progress in recent years in the quantitative understanding of the nonequilibrium time evolution of quantum fields. Important topical applications, in particular in high energy particle physics and cosmology, involve dynamics of quantum fields far away from the ground state or thermal equilibrium. In these cases, standard approaches based on small deviations from equilibrium, or on a sufficient homogeneity in time underlying kinetic descriptions, are not applicable. A particular challenge is to connect the far-from-equilibrium dynamics at early times with the approach to thermal equilibrium at late times. Understanding the ``link'' between the early- and the late-time behavior of quantum fields is crucial for a wide range of phenomena. For the first time questions such as the explosive particle production at the end of the inflationary universe, including the subsequent process of thermalization, can be addressed in quantum field theory from first principles. The progress in this field is based on efficient functional integral techniques, so-called n-particle irreducible effective actions, for which powerful nonperturbative approximation schemes are available. Here we give an introduction to these techniques and show how they can be applied in practice. Though we focus on particle physics and cosmology applications, we emphasize that these techniques can be equally applied to other nonequilibrium phenomena in complex many body systems.},

At the same time, the necessity to go beyond simple golden rule-type expressions for rates was indicated in the literature and ad hoc formulations were proposed. Similarly, kinetic schemes for quantum transport beyond the usual second-order Lindblad/Redfield considerations were discussed. Here we utilize recently introduced the nonequilibrium Hubbard Green's function diagrammatic technique to analyze the construction of rates in open systems. We show that previous considerations for rates of second and fourth order can be obtained as a particular case of zero- and second-order Green's function diagrammatic series with bare diagrams. We discuss limitations of previous considerations, stress advantages of the Hubbard Green's function approach in constructing the rates, and indicate that standard dressing of the diagrams is a natural way to account for additional baths/degrees of freedom in the formulation of generalized expressions for the rates.},

We address a longstanding theoretical issue, namely whether singlet fission proceeds via two sequential electron transfer steps mediated by charge-transfer states or via a direct two-electron transfer process. We find evidence for a superexchange mediated mechanism, whereby the fission process proceeds through virtual charge-transfer states which may be very high in energy. In particular, this mechanism predicts efficient singlet fission on the sub-picosecond timescale, in reasonable agreement with experiment. We investigate the role played by molecular vibrations in mediating relaxation and decoherence, finding that different physically reasonable forms for the bath relaxation function give similar results. We also examine the competing direct coupling mechanism and find it to yield fission rates slower in comparison with the superexchange mechanism for the dimer. We discuss implications for crystalline pentacene, including the limitations of the dimer model.},

The broad applicability is demonstrated with the examples of a harmonic oscillator and different states of water. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations have been performed for ideal gas up to the temperature of 5000 K. Classical molecular dynamics have been carried out for hexagonal ice, liquid water, and vapor at atmospheric pressure. With respect to the experimental heat capacity, our method outperforms previous calculations in the literature in a wide temperature range at lower computational cost than other alternatives.

Many physically relevant models in one dimension are Bethe-ansatz integrable, including the anisotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg (also called the spin-1/2 XXZ chain) and the Fermi-Hubbard model. Nevertheless, practical computations of correlation functions and transport coefficients pose hard problems from both the conceptual and technical points of view. Only because of recent progress in the theory of integrable systems, on the one hand, and the development of numerical methods, on the other hand, has it become possible to compute their finite-temperature and nonequilibrium transport properties quantitatively. Owing to the discovery of a novel class of quasilocal conserved quantities, there is now a qualitative understanding of the origin of ballistic finite-temperature transport, and even diffusive or superdiffusive subleading corrections, in integrable lattice models. The current understanding of transport in one-dimensional lattice models, in particular, in the paradigmatic example of the spin-1/2 XXZ and Fermi-Hubbard models, is reviewed, as well as state-of-the-art theoretical methods, including both analytical and computational approaches. Among other novel techniques, matrix-product-state-based simulation methods, dynamical typicality, and, in particular, generalized hydrodynamics are covered. The close and fruitful connection between theoretical models and recent experiments is discussed, with examples given from the realms of both quantum magnets and ultracold quantum gases in optical lattices.},

Computational modeling rationalizes the appearance of a ``chain-shaped'' rather than a ``star-shaped'' gallium chloride anion as well as the reasons why the trimer, rather than a radical cation aggregate of different size, is preferred in this system. Moreover, the calculations allowed evaluation of larger cationic triphenylene radical {$\pi$}-stacked aggregates. Additional stabilization due to the shared single unpaired electron is calculated to remain significant at 5--7 kcal mol-1 for aggregates as large as 5--6 units.},

  abstract = {Singlet fission is a new mechanistic pathway to overcome the Shockley--Queisser limit by generating twice the number of triplet excitons per singly absorbed photon in selected materials. The first step of the singlet fission (SF) is initiated by the capture of sunlight by chromophores in the visible region, which is the prime factor for subsequent transfer of the excited energies to the neighboring chromophores. The key electronic properties of organic chromophores for SF are dictated by the interplay of the electronic states involved in this process. The separation of two triplet excitons from the correlated triplet pair strongly depends on the molecular structure and their packing motif though either a covalent or noncovalent packing orientation that controls the efficiency of SF. In this Feature Article, we discuss the SF mechanism considering the thermodynamic condition, its correlation to the molecular structure, and, finally, its effects on the triplet yield generation from the first-principles computation. The discussion ranges from the single molecule to a dimeric pair of crystalline states in the context of technological importance and design principle rules for SF. Finally, we end this Feature Article with a brief overview of the experimental findings of our proposed chromophores in terms of the applicability in SF.},

To alleviate this task's often prohibitive computational expense, we propose a Mori-based generalized quantum master equation (GQME) to predict the frequency-resolved conductivity of small-polaron forming systems described by the dispersive Holstein model. Unlike previous GQME-based approaches to transport that scale with the system size and only give access to the DC conductivity, our method requires only one calculation and yields both the DC and AC mobilities. We further show how to easily augment our GQME with numerically accessible derivatives of the current to increase computational efficiency, collectively offering computational cost reductions of up to 90\%, depending on the transport regime. Finally, we leverage our exact simulations to demonstrate the limited applicability of the celebrated and widely invoked Drude--Smith model in small-polaron forming systems. We instead introduce a cumulant-based analysis of experimentally accessible frequency data to infer the microscopic Hamiltonian parameters. This approach promises to provide valuable insights into material properties and facilitate guided design by linking macroscopic terahertz measurements to the microscopic details of small polaron-forming systems.},

We have computed eigenstates in different subspaces using both unrelaxed and relaxed potentials based on the DGEVB model. With unrelaxed potentials, we present results up to 7D subspaces that include the imaginary frequency mode and six modes coupled to it. With relaxed potentials, we focus on the two most important coupling modes. The structures of the ground and vibrationally excited eigenstates are discussed for both approaches and mode-specific tunneling splitting and their trends are presented.},

We find that while Q10 strongly modulates the donor--acceptor distance, it does not exchange energy with Q1.

To date, photons (either optical or microwave) have been the carrier of choice to transfer quantum states between the qubits. For some solid-state systems, however, the vibrational properties of the materials themselves, phonons, could be advantageous. Bienfait et al. describe the deterministic emission and capture of itinerant phonons through an acoustic communication channel, enabling the phonon-based coherent transfer of quantum states from one superconducting qubit to another and the quantum entanglement of the two qubits over the acoustic channel. The results provide a route to couple hybrid quantum solid-state systems using surface acoustic waves. Science, this issue p. 368 Itinerant phonons are used for the coherent transfer of quantum states from one superconducting qubit to another. Phonons, and in particular surface acoustic wave phonons, have been proposed as a means to coherently couple distant solid-state quantum systems. Individual phonons in a resonant structure can be controlled and detected by superconducting qubits, enabling the coherent generation and measurement of complex stationary phonon states. We report the deterministic emission and capture of itinerant surface acoustic wave phonons, enabling the quantum entanglement of two superconducting qubits. Using a 2-millimeter-long acoustic quantum communication channel, equivalent to a 500-nanosecond delay line, we demonstrate the emission and recapture of a phonon by one superconducting qubit, quantum state transfer between two superconducting qubits with a 67\% efficiency, and, by partial transfer of a phonon, generation of an entangled Bell pair with a fidelity of 84\%.},

Here, we show that in confined systems the thermalization dynamics after a quantum quench instead exhibits multiple stages with well separated time scales. As an example, we consider the confined Ising spin chain, in which domain walls in the ordered phase form bound states reminiscent of mesons. The system first relaxes towards a prethermal state, described by a Gibbs ensemble with conserved meson number. The prethermal state arises from rare events in which mesons are created in close vicinity, leading to an avalanche of scattering events. Only at much later times a true thermal equilibrium is achieved in which the meson number conservation is violated by a mechanism akin to the Schwinger effect. The discussed prethermalization dynamics is directly relevant to generic one-dimensional, many-body systems with confined excitations.},

Following the observation of long-lived beats in 2D electronic spectroscopy of PC645, vibronic coherence, the delocalization of excited states between pigments supported by a resonant vibration, has been proposed to enable direct excitation transport from the highest-energy to the lowest-energy pigments, bypassing a collection of intermediate states. Here, we instead show that for phycobiliprotein PC645 an incoherent vibronic transport mechanism is at play. We quantify the solvation dynamics of individual pigments using ab initio quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) nuclear dynamics. Our atomistic spectral densities reproduce experimental observations ranging from absorption and fluorescence spectra to the timescales and selectivity of down-conversion observed in transient absorption measurements. We construct a general model for vibronic dimers and establish the parameter regimes of coherent and incoherent vibronic transport. We demonstrate that direct down-conversion in PC645 proceeds incoherently, enhanced by large reorganization energies and a broad collection of high-frequency vibrations. We suggest that a similar incoherent mechanism is appropriate across phycobiliproteins and represents a potential design principle for nanoscale control of EET.},

The vMCG calculation is shown to converge quite well with about 100 variationally evolving Gaussian functions and using a local cubic expansion instead of the conventional local harmonic approximation. By contrast, the HK-SCIVR approach with {$\sim$}105 trajectories reproduces the vibrationally structured spectral envelope correctly but yields a strongly broadened spectrum. The comparison of the computed absorption spectrum with experiment shows that the relevant vibronic progressions are reasonably reproduced by all computations, but deviations of the order of 10--100 cm--1 occur, underscoring that both electronic structure calculations and dynamical approaches remain challenging in the calculation of typical small-molecule excited-state spectra by trajectory-based methods.},

  abstract = {Recent method developments involving path integral simulations have come a long way in making these techniques practical for studying condensed phase non-equilibrium phenomena. One of the main difficulties that still needs to be surmounted is the scaling of the algorithms with the system dimensionality. The majority of recent techniques have only changed the order of this scaling (going from exponential to possibly a very high-ordered polynomial) and not eased the dependence on the system size. In this current work, we introduce an adaptive kink filtration technique for the path generation approach that leverages the locality of the interactions present in the system and the consequent sparsity of the propagator matrix to remove the asymptotic size dependence of the simulations for the propagation of reduced density matrices. This enables the simulation of larger systems at a significantly reduced cost. This technique can be used for simulation of both non-equilibrium dynamics and equilibrium correlation functions and is demonstrated here using examples from both. We show that the cost becomes constant with the dimensionality of the system. The only place where a system size-dependence still remains is the calculation of the dynamical maps or propagators, which are important for the transfer tensor method. The cost of calculating this solvent-renormalized propagator is the same as the cost of propagating all the elements of the reduced density matrix, which scales as the square of the size. This adaptive kink-filtration technique promises to be instrumental in extending the affordability of path integral simulations for very large systems.},

  abstract = {The accurate evaluation of the Wigner phase space density for multidimensional system remains a challenging task. Path integral Monte Carlo methods offer a numerically exact approach for obtaining the Boltzmann density in coordinate space, but the Fourier-type integral required to construct the Wigner distribution generally leads to poor convergence. This paper describes a path integral method for constructing the Wigner density which substantially mitigates the Monte Carlo sign problem and thus is applicable to systems with many degrees of freedom. The starting point is the path integral representation of the coherent state density, which does not involve a Fourier integral and thus converges rapidly. We then use the relation between the coherent state and Wigner densities to construct the Wigner function, taking advantage of destructive phase cancellation to truncate the infinite series and thus confine the integrand, avoiding highly oscillatory regions. We also describe the use of information-guided noise reduction (IGNoR) to improve the Monte Carlo statistics in the most challenging regimes. The method is applied to strongly anharmonic one-dimensional models, a system-bath Hamiltonian, as well as the formamide molecule within an ab initio quartic potential, and the results are compared to those obtained by various approximate methods. These calculations suggest that the coherent state-based path integral method described in this paper offers an efficient, numerically exact approach for constructing the Wigner phase space density in systems of many degrees of freedom, and thus will be useful for quantizing the initial condition in classical trajectory-based simulations of dynamical properties.},

Here, MS-TNPI is used to study the ``non-equilibrium'' effects of an externally imposed temperature profile on the excitonic transport in one-dimensional Frenkel chains coupled with local vibrations.

There are broadly two different aspects of the problem that affect the route taken. First is obviously the couplings between the various sites, which translates into the intrinsic ``strength'' of a state-to-state channel. Apart from these inter-state couplings, the relative coupling strengths and timescales of the solvent modes form the second factor. This impact of the dissipative environment is significantly more difficult to analyze. Building on the recently derived relations between coherences and population derivatives, we present an analysis of the transport that allows us to account for both the effects in a rigorous manner. We demonstrate the richness hidden behind the transport even for a relatively simple system, a 4-site coarse-grained model of the Fenna--Matthews--Olson complex. The effect of the local dissipative media is highly nontrivial. We show that while the impact on the total site population may be small, there are noticeable changes to the pathway taken by the transport process. We also demonstrate how an analysis in a similar spirit can be done using the F{\"o}rster approximation. The ability to untangle the dynamics at a greater granularity opens up possibilities in terms of design of novel systems with an eye toward quantum control.},

Over the past decade, very accurate spectral densities have been developed to capture spatial inhomogeneities in the Fenna--Matthews--Olson (FMO) complex. However, challenges persist in numerically simulating these systems, both in terms of parameterizing them and following their dynamics over long periods of time because of long non-Markovian memories. We investigate the dynamics of FMO with the exact treatment of various theoretical spectral densities using the new tensor network path integral-based methods, which are uniquely capable of addressing the difficulty of long memory length and incoherent F{\"o}rster theory. It is also important to be able to analyze the pathway of EET flow, which can be difficult to identify given the non-trivial structure of connections between bacteriochlorophyll molecules in FMO. We use the recently introduced ideas of relating coherence to population derivatives to analyze the transport process and reveal some new routes of transport. The combination of exact and approximate methods sheds light on the role of coherences in affecting the fine details of the transport and promises to be a powerful toolbox for future exploration of other open systems with quantum transport.},

However, these methods scale exponentially with the system size. This makes it challenging to simulate the non-equilibrium dynamics of extended quantum systems coupled with local dissipative environments. In this work, we extend the tensor network path integral (TNPI) framework to efficiently simulate such extended systems. The Feynman--Vernon influence functional is a popular approach used to account for the effect of environments on the dynamics of the system. In order to facilitate the incorporation of the influence functional into a multisite framework (MS-TNPI), we combine a matrix product state (MPS) decomposition of the reduced density tensor of the system along the sites with a corresponding tensor network representation of the time axis to construct an efficient 2D tensor network. The 2D MS-TNPI network, when contracted, yields the time-dependent reduced density tensor of the extended system as an MPS. The algorithm presented is independent of the system Hamiltonian. We outline an iteration scheme to take the simulation beyond the non-Markovian memory introduced by solvents. Applications to spin chains coupled to local harmonic baths are presented; we consider the Ising, XXZ, and Heisenberg models, demonstrating that the presence of local environments can often dissipate the entanglement between the sites. We discuss three factors causing the system to transition from a coherent oscillatory dynamics to a fully incoherent dynamics. The MS-TNPI method is useful for studying a variety of extended quantum systems coupled with solvents.},

When the reactants are described by a single quantum state, as in the case of electron transfer reactions, the factorized reactant density describes the true initial condition of the reactive process. In such cases, the time integral of the non-equilibrium flux expression yields the reactant population as a function of time, allowing characterization of the dynamics in cases where there is no clear separation of time scales and thus a plateau regime cannot be identified.

  abstract = {Hyperuniform states of matter are characterized by anomalous suppression of long-wavelength density fluctuations. While most of the interesting cases of disordered hyperuniformity are provided by complex many-body systems such as liquids or amorphous solids, classical spin chains with certain long-range interactions have been shown to demonstrate the same phenomenon. Such spin-chain systems are ideal models for exploring the effects of quantum mechanics on hyperuniformity. It is well-known that the transverse field Ising model shows a quantum phase transition (QPT) at zero temperature. Under the quantum effects of a transverse magnetic field, classical hyperuniform spin chains are expected to lose their hyperuniformity. High-precision simulations of these cases are complicated because of the presence of highly nontrivial long-range interactions. We perform an extensive analysis of these systems using density matrix renormalization group simulations to study the possibilities of phase transitions and the mechanism by which they lose hyperuniformity. Even for a spin chain of length 30, we see discontinuous changes in properties like the ``{$\tau$} order metric'' of the ground state, the measure of hyperuniformity, and the second cumulant of the total magnetization along the x-direction, all suggestive of first-order QPTs. An interesting feature of the phase transitions in these disordered hyperuniform spin chains is that, depending on the parameter values, the presence of a transverse magnetic field may lead remarkably to an increase in the order of the ground state as measured by the ``{$\tau$} order metric,'' even if hyperuniformity is lost. Therefore, it would be possible to design materials to target specific novel quantum behaviors in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. Our numerical investigations suggest that these spin chains can show no more than two QPTs. We further analyze the long-range interacting spin chains via the Jordan-Wigner mapping onto a system of spinless fermions, showing that under the pairwise-interaction approximation and a mean-field treatment, there can be at most two quantum phase transitions. Based on these numerical and theoretical explorations, we conjecture that for spin chains with long-range pair interactions that have convergent cosine transforms, there can be a maximum of two quantum phase transitions at zero temperature.},

We show that the operator dependence of the phase space distribution can be transferred to the dynamics, allowing sampling from the simpler Wigner phase space density. The method involves augmenting the classical equations of motion with additional differential equations for elements of the stability matrix. We also propose a local harmonic approximation for the dynamical derivatives, which significantly reduces the computational cost required to obtain correlation functions of nonlinear operators.

The MS-TNPI network is extended to account for the ring topology of the B850 system. Accurate molecular-dynamics-based description of the molecular vibrations and the protein scaffold is incorporated through the framework of Feynman--Vernon influence functional. To relate the present work with the excitonic picture, an exploration of the absorption spectrum is done by simulating it using approximate and topologically consistent transition dipole moment vectors. Comparison of these numerically exact MS-TNPI absorption spectra are shown with second-order cumulant approximations. The effect of temperature on both the exact and the approximate spectra is also explored.},

A novel tensor network-based decomposition of real-time path integral simulations involving Feynman-Vernon influence functional is introduced. In this tensor network path integral (TNPI) technique, the finitetemporarily non-local interactions introduced by the influence functional can be captured very effi-ciently using matrix product state representation for the path-dependent Green's function (PDGF). We illustrate this particular TNPI method through various realistic examples, including a chargetransfer reaction and an exciton transfer in a dimer. We also show how it is readily applied to systems with greater than two states. PDGF-TNPI utilizes the symmetries of the problem, leading to accelerated convergence and dramatic reductions of computational effort. We also introduce anapproximate method that speeds up propagation beyond the non-local memory length. Further-more, the structure imposed by the tensor network representation of the PDGF naturally suggests other factorizations that make simulations for extended systems more efficient. These factorizations would be the subject of future explorations. The flexibility of the PDGF-TNPI framework makesit a promising new addition to the family of path integral methods for non-equilibrium quantum dynamics.},

The adiabatically switched Wigner (ASW) distribution is an approximation to the exact Wigner function, which was found to be highly accurate on model systems. In this paper we discuss the implementation of the ASW procedure to polyatomic molecules both in normal mode coordinates and in Cartesian coordinates. We present its application to a six-degree-of-freedom model based on an ab initio quartic potential energy surface developed for formaldehyde in the normal mode representation and for butyne in Cartesian coordinates using the CHARMM force field. Comparisons of equilibrium properties against accurate quantum mechanical results indicate that the ASW is reliable and highly accurate over a wide temperature range in both the coordinate systems. Further, the ASW density is invariant under classical evolution, thus it is ideally suited to quasiclassical trajectory simulations. We also describe a very simple ASW-based procedure for obtaining complex-valued quasiclassical time correlation functions and vibrational spectra.},

  abstract = {Evaluation of the Wigner phase space density for systems of many degrees of freedom presents an extremely demanding task because of the oscillatory nature of the Fourier-type integral. We propose a simple and efficient, approximate procedure for generating the Wigner distribution that avoids the computational difficulties associated with the Wigner transform. Starting from a suitable zeroth-order Hamiltonian, for which the Wigner density is available (either analytically or numerically), the phase space distribution is propagated in time via classical trajectories, while the perturbation is gradually switched on. According to the classical adiabatic theorem, each trajectory maintains a constant action if the perturbation is switched on infinitely slowly. We show that the adiabatic switching procedure produces the exact Wigner density for harmonic oscillator eigenstates and also for eigenstates of anharmonic Hamiltonians within the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation. We generalize the approach to finite temperature by introducing a density rescaling factor that depends on the energy of each trajectory. Time-dependent properties are obtained simply by continuing the integration of each trajectory under the full target Hamiltonian. Further, by construction, the generated approximate Wigner distribution is invariant under classical propagation, and thus, thermodynamic properties are strictly preserved. Numerical tests on one-dimensional and dissipative systems indicate that the method produces results in very good agreement with those obtained by full quantum mechanical methods over a wide temperature range. The method is simple and efficient, as it requires no input besides the force fields required for classical trajectory integration, and is ideal for use in quasiclassical trajectory calculations.},

However, the accuracy of this procedure depends on the validity of the high temperature approximation. In this work, an alternative derivation based on the Kubo formalism is provided. This enables the calculation of additional correction terms that increases the range of applicability of the procedure to lower temperatures. Because it is based on the Kubo-transformed correlation function, this approach allows the direct use of correlation functions obtained from methods such as ring-polymer molecular dynamics and centroid molecular dynamics in determining the influence functional coefficients for subsequent system-solvent simulations. The accuracy of the original procedure and the corrected procedure is investigated across a range of parameters. It is interesting that the correction term comes at zero additional cost. Furthermore, it is possible to improve upon the correction using zero-cost physical intuition and heuristics making the method even more accurate.},

We use the Bloch--Redfield (BR) formalism, valid in the very weak system--bath coupling limit, the noninteracting-blip approximation (NIBA), applicable in the nonadiabatic limit, and iterative, numerically exact path integral tools. These methodologies were originally developed for the description of the dissipative dynamics of a quantum system, and here they are applied to explore the problem of quantum energy transport in a nonequilibrium setting. Specifically, we study the weak-to-intermediate system--bath coupling regime at high temperatures kBT/ℏ {\textbackslash}textgreater {$\epsilon$}, with {$\epsilon$} as the characteristic frequency of the two-state system. The BR formalism and NIBA can lead to close results for the dynamics of the reduced density matrix (RDM) in a certain range of parameters. However, relatively small deviations in the RDM dynamics propagate into significant qualitative discrepancies in the transport behavior. Similarly, beyond the strict nonadiabatic limit NIBA's prediction for the heat current is qualitatively incorrect: It fails to capture the turnover behavior of the current with tunneling energy and temperature. Thus, techniques that proved meaningful for describing the RDM dynamics, to some extent even beyond their rigorous range of validity, should be used with great caution in heat transfer calculations, because qualitative-serious failures develop once parameters are mildly stretched beyond the techniques' working assumptions.},

  abstract = {Absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy techniques provide a wealth of information on molecular systems. The simulations of such experiments remain challenging, however, despite the efforts put into developing the underlying theory. An attractive method of simulating the behavior of molecular systems is provided by the quantum--classical theory-it enables one to keep track of the state of the bath explicitly, which is needed for accurate calculations of fluorescence spectra. Unfortunately, until now there have been relatively few works that apply quantum--classical methods for modeling spectroscopic data. In this work, we seek to provide a framework for the calculations of absorption and fluorescence lineshapes of molecular systems using the methods based on the quantum--classical Liouville equation, namely, the forward--backward trajectory solution (FBTS) and the non-Hamiltonian variant of the Poisson bracket mapping equation (PBME-nH). We perform calculations on a molecular dimer and the photosynthetic Fenna--Matthews--Olson complex. We find that in the case of absorption, the FBTS outperforms PBME-nH, consistently yielding highly accurate results. We next demonstrate that for fluorescence calculations, the method of choice is a hybrid approach, which we call PBME-nH-Jeff, that utilizes the effective coupling theory [Gelzinis, A.; J. Chem. Phys. 2020, 152, 051103] to estimate the excited state equilibrium density operator. Thus, we find that FBTS and PBME-nH-Jeff are excellent candidates for simulating, respectively, absorption and fluorescence spectra of real molecular systems.},

Modeling these data with a three-level displaced harmonic oscillator model using the hierarchical equation of motion-phase matching approach (HEOM-PMA) shows that the S1 {\textleftarrow} S0 PES displacement is greater along the 585 cm--1 coordinate than the 338 cm--1 coordinate, while Sn {\textleftarrow} S1 displacements are similar along both coordinates.

Thermal expansion, magnetostriction, specific heat, magnetization, and magnetocaloric measurements are found to be in excellent agreement with exact Bethe-Ansatz predictions. Close to the critical field, thermodynamics obeys the expected quantum critical scaling behavior, and in particular, the magnetocaloric effect and the Gr{\"u}neisen parameters diverge in a characteristic manner.

  abstract = {The generalized quantum master equation (GQME) provides a general and exact approach for simulating the reduced dynamics in open quantum systems where a quantum system is embedded in a quantum environment. Dynamics of open quantum systems is important in excitation energy, charge, and quantum coherence transfer as well as reactive photochemistry. The system is usually chosen to be the interested degrees of freedom such as the electronic states in light-harvesting molecules or tagged vibrational modes in a condensed-phase system. The environment is also called the bath, whose influence on the system has to be considered, and for instance can be described by the GQME formalisms using the projection operator technique. In this review, we provide a heuristic description of the development of two canonical forms of GQME, namely the time-convoluted Nakajima-Zwanzig form (NZ-GQME) and the time-convolutionless form (TCL-GQME). In the more popular NZ-GQME form, the memory kernel serves as the essential part that reflects the non-Markovian and non-perturbative effects, which gives formally exact dynamics of the reduced density matrix. We summarize several schemes to express the projection-based memory kernel of NZ-GQME in terms of projection-free time correlation function inputs that contain molecular information. In particular, the recently proposed modified GQME approach based on NZ-GQME partitions the Hamiltonian into a more general diagonal and off-diagonal parts. The projection-free inputs in the above-mentioned schemes expressed in terms of different system-dependent time correlation functions can be calculated via numerically exact or approximate dynamical methods. We hope this contribution would help lower the barrier of understanding the theoretical pillars for GQME-based quantum dynamics methods and also envisage that their combination with the quantum computing techniques will pave the way for solving complex problems related to quantum dynamics and quantum information that are currently intractable even with today's state-of-the-art classical supercomputers.},

The high level of accuracy that can be attained by these potential energy functions (PEFs) is due in large part to their specificity: for each term in the many-body expansion, a species-specific training set must be generated at the desired level of theory and a number of fits attempted in order to obtain a robust and reliable PEF. In this work, we attempt to characterize the numerical aspects of the fitting problem, addressing questions which are of simultaneous practical and fundamental importance. These include concrete illustrations of the nonconvexity of the problem, the ill-conditionedness of the linear system to be solved and possible need for regularization, the sensitivity of the solutions to the characteristics of the training set, and limitations of the approach with respect to accuracy and the types of molecules that can be treated. In addition, we introduce a general approach to the generation of training set configurations based on the familiar harmonic approximation and evaluate the possible benefits to the use of quasirandom sequences for sampling configuration space in this context. Using sulfate as a case study, the findings are largely generalizable and expected to ultimately facilitate the efficient development of PIP-based many-body PEFs for general systems via automation.},

  abstract = {Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions are ubiquitous natural processes at the heart of energy conversion reactions in photosynthesis and respiration, DNA repair, and diverse enzymatic reactions. Theoretical formulation and computational method developments have eyed modeling of thermal and photoinduced PCET for the last three decades. The accumulation of these studies, collected in dozens of reviews, accounts, and perspectives, has firmly established the influence of quantum effects, including non-adiabatic electronic transitions, vibrational relaxation, zero-point energy, and proton tunneling, on the rate and mechanism of PCET reactions. Here, we focus on some recently-developed methods, spanning the last eight years, that can quantitatively capture these effects in the PCET context and provide efficient means for their qualitative description in complex systems. The theoretical background of each method and their accuracy with respect to exact results are discussed and the results of relevant PCET simulations based on each method are presented.},

First of all, we revisit the reference CCSD(T) ionization potentials for this popular benchmark set and establish a revised set of CCSD(T) results. Then, for all of these 100 molecules, we calculate the HOMO energy within second and third-order perturbation theory (PT2 and PT3), and, GW as post-Hartree-Fock methods. We found GW to be the most accurate of these three approximations for the ionization potential, by far. Going beyond GW by adding more diagrams is a tedious and dangerous activity: We tried to complement GW with second-order exchange (SOX), with second-order screened exchange (SOSEX), with interacting electron-hole pairs (WTDHF), and with a GW density-matrix ({$\gamma$}GW). Only the {$\gamma$}GW result has a positive impact. Finally using an improved hybrid functional for the non-interacting Green's function, considering it as a cheap way to approximate self-consistency, the accuracy of the simplest GW approximation improves even more. We conclude that GW is a miracle: Its subtle balance makes GW both accurate and fast.},

  abstract = {Optical nonlinear spectroscopies carry a high amount of information about the systems under investigation; however, as they report polarization signals, the resulting spectra are often congested and difficult to interpret. To recover the landscape of energy states and physical processes such as energy and electron transfer, a clear interpretation of the nonlinear signals is prerequisite. Here, we focus on the interpretation of the electrochromic band-shift signal, which is generated when an internal electric field is established in the system following optical excitation. Whereas the derivative shape of the band-shift signal is well understood in transient absorption spectroscopy, its emergence in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) has not been discussed. In this work, we employed 2DES to follow the dynamic band-shift signal in reaction centers of purple bacteria Rhodobacter sphaeroides at 77 K. The prominent two-dimensional derivative-shape signal appears with the characteristic formation time of the charge separated state. To explain and characterize the band-shift signal, we use expanded double-sided Feynman diagram formalism. We propose to distinguish two types of Feynman diagrams that lead to signals with negative amplitude: excited state absorption and re-excitation. The presented signal decomposition and modeling analysis allows us to recover precise electrochromic shifts of accessory bacteriochlorophylls, identify additional signals in the B band range, and gain a further insight into the electron transfer mechanism. In a broader perspective, expanded Feynman diagram formalism will allow for interpretation of all 2D signals in a clearer and more intuitive way and therefore facilitate studying the underlying photophysics.},

Numerical advances, based on tensor-network methods, have shown that transport in many canonical integrable spin chains---most famously the Heisenberg model---is anomalous. Concurrently, the framework of generalized hydrodynamics has been extended to explain some of the mechanisms underlying anomalous transport. We present what is currently understood about these mechanisms, and discuss how they resemble (and differ from) the mechanisms for anomalous transport in other contexts. We also briefly review potential transport anomalies in systems where integrability is an emergent or approximate property. We survey instances of anomalous transport and dynamics that remain to be understood.},

Here, we present MB-Fit, a software infrastructure for the automated development of MB-PEFs for generic molecules within the TTM-nrg (Thole-type model energy) and MB-nrg (many-body energy) theoretical frameworks. Besides providing all the necessary computational tools for generating TTM-nrg and MB-nrg PEFs, MB-Fit provides a seamless interface with the MBX software, a many-body energy and force calculator for computer simulations. Given the demonstrated accuracy of the MB-PEFs, particularly within the MB-nrg framework, we believe that MB-Fit will enable routine predictive computer simulations of generic (small) molecules in the gas, liquid, and solid phases, including, but not limited to, the modeling of quantum isomeric equilibria in molecular clusters, solvation processes, molecular crystals, and phase diagrams.},

This approach results in an approximate calculation of a real-time path-integral in a discrete coherent-state representation, which becomes exact in the limit of sufficiently short time-slice intervals. The efficiency of the computational method is optimized by devising a compact coherent-state basis set that obviates the need for calculating the inverse overlap matrix. Quantitative agreement with full quantum mechanical results is verified in the description of tunneling between disjoint classically allowed regions in one- and two-dimensional systems, in the treatment of long-time dynamics, and in nonadiabatic dynamics in a model system with two coupled one-dimensional potential energy surfaces.},

As in the related, well established D3 scheme, these are obtained as a sum of atom-in-molecule dispersion coefficients over atom pairs. Both models make use of dynamic polarizabilities obtained from first-principles time-dependent density functional theory calculations for atoms in different chemical environments employing fractional atomic coordination numbers for interpolation. Different from the D3 model, the coefficients are obtained on-the-fly by numerical Casimir-Polder integration of the dynamic, atomic polarizabilities {$\alpha$}(i{$\omega$}). Most importantly, electronic density information is now incorporated via atomic partial charges computed at a semi-empirical quantum mechanical tight-binding level, which is used to scale the polarizabilities. Extended statistical measures show that errors for dispersion coefficients with the proposed D4 method are significantly lower than with D3 and other, computationally more involved schemes. Alongside, accurate isotropic charge and hybridization dependent, atom-in-molecule static polarizabilities are obtained with an unprecedented efficiency. Damping function parameters are provided for three standard density functionals, i.e., TPSS, PBE0, and B3LYP, allowing evaluation of the new DFT-D4 model for common non-covalent interaction energy benchmark sets.},

  abstract = {Confined electromagnetic modes strongly couple to collective excitations in ensembles of quantum emitters, producing light--matter hybrid states known as polaritons. Under such conditions, the discrete multilevel spectrum of molecular systems offers an appealing playground for exploring multiphoton processes. This work contrasts predictions from the Tavis--Cummings model in which the material is a collection of two-level systems, with the implications of considering additional energy levels with harmonic and anharmonic structures. We discuss the exact eigenspectrum, up to the second excitation manifold, of an arbitrary number N of oscillators collectively coupled to a single cavity mode in the rotating-wave approximation. Elaborating on our group-theoretic approach [New J. Phys. 23, 063081 (2021)], we simplify the brute-force diagonalization of N2 {\texttimes} N2 Hamiltonians to the eigendecomposition of, at most, 4 {\texttimes} 4 matrices for arbitrary N. We thoroughly discuss the eigenstates and the consequences of weak and strong anharmonicities. Furthermore, we find resonant conditions between bipolaritons and anharmonic transitions where two-photon absorption can be enhanced. Finally, we conclude that energy shifts in the polaritonic states induced by anharmonicities become negligible for large N. Thus, calculations with a single or few quantum emitters qualitatively fail to represent the nonlinear optical response of the collective strong coupling regime. Our work highlights the rich physics of multilevel anharmonic systems coupled to cavities absent in standard models of quantum optics. We also provide concise tabulated expressions for eigenfrequencies and transition amplitudes, which should serve as a reference for future spectroscopic studies of molecular polaritons.},

  abstract = {Many enzymatic reactions in biochemistry are far more complex than the celebrated Michaelis-Menten scheme, but the observed turnover rate often obeys the hyperbolic dependence on the substrate concentration, a relation established almost a century ago for the simple Michaelis-Menten mechanism. To resolve the longstanding puzzle, we apply the flux balance method to predict the functional form of the substrate dependence in the mean turnover time of complex enzymatic reactions and identify detailed balance (i.e., the lack of unbalanced conformtional current) as a sufficient condition for the Michaelis-Menten equation to describe the substrate concentration dependence of the turnover rate in an enzymatic network. This prediction can be verified in single-molecule event-averaged measurements using the recently proposed signatures of detailed balance violations. The finding helps analyze recent single-molecule studies of enzymatic networks and can be applied to other external variables, such as force-dependence and voltage-dependence.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we establish optimal conditions for maximal energy transfer efficiency using solutions for multilevel systems and interpret these analytical solutions with more intuitive kinetic networks resulting from a systematic mapping procedure. The mapping procedure defines an effective hopping rate as the leading order picture and nonlocal kinetic couplings as the quantum correction, hence leading to a rigorous separation of thermal hopping and coherent transfer useful for visualizing pathway connectivity and interference in quantum networks. As a result of these calculations, the dissipative effects of the surrounding environments can be optimized to yield the maximal efficiency, and modulation of the efficiency can be achieved using the cumulative quantum phase along any closed loops. The optimal coupling of the system and its environments is interpreted with the generic mechanisms: (i) balancing localized trapping and delocalized coherence, (ii) reducing the effective detuning via homogeneous line-broadening, (iii) suppressing the destructive interference in nonlinear network configurations, and (iv) controlling phase modulation in closed loop configurations. Though these results are obtained for simple model systems, the physics thus derived provides insights into the working of light harvesting systems, and the approaches thus developed apply to large-scale computation.},

Photosynthesis is a highly optimized process from which valuable lessons can be learned about the operating principles in nature. Its primary steps involve energy transport operating near theoretical quantum limits in efficiency. Recently, extensive research was motivated by the hypothesis that nature used quantum coherences to direct energy transfer. This body of work, a cornerstone for the field of quantum biology, rests on the interpretation of small-amplitude oscillations in two-dimensional electronic spectra of photosynthetic complexes. This Review discusses recent work reexamining these claims and demonstrates that interexciton coherences are too short lived to have any functional significance in photosynthetic energy transfer. Instead, the observed long-lived coherences originate from impulsively excited vibrations, generally observed in femtosecond spectroscopy. These efforts, collectively, lead to a more detailed understanding of the quantum aspects of dissipation. Nature, rather than trying to avoid dissipation, exploits it via engineering of exciton-bath interaction to create efficient energy flow.},

Although many approximation methods have been introduced, the complexity of quantum mechanics remains hard to appease. The advent of quantum computation brings new pathways to navigate this challenging and complex landscape. By manipulating quantum states of matter and taking advantage of their unique features such as superposition and entanglement, quantum computers promise to efficiently deliver accurate results for many important problems in quantum chemistry, such as the electronic structure of molecules. In the past two decades, significant advances have been made in developing algorithms and physical hardware for quantum computing, heralding a revolution in simulation of quantum systems. This Review provides an overview of the algorithms and results that are relevant for quantum chemistry. The intended audience is both quantum chemists who seek to learn more about quantum computing and quantum computing researchers who would like to explore applications in quantum chemistry.},

Also closed quanto-mechanical systems may stop wandering freely around the whole Hilbert space, even if they are initially prepared into a macroscopically large combination of eigenstates. Here, we report numerical evidences that the dynamics of strongly interacting lattice bosons driven sufficiently far from equilibrium can be trapped into extremely long-lived inhomogeneous metastable states. The slowing down of incoherent density excitations above a threshold energy, much reminiscent of a dynamical arrest on the verge of a glass transition, is identified as the key feature of this phenomenon. We argue that the resulting long-lived inhomogeneities are responsible for the lack of thermalization observed in large systems. Such a rich phenomenology could be experimentally uncovered upon probing the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of conveniently prepared quantum states of trapped cold atoms which we hereby suggest.},

We show that the generalization error of a quantum machine learning model with T trainable gates scales at worst as \$\${\textbackslash}sqrt\{T/N\}\$\$. When only K\,{$\ll$}\,T gates have undergone substantial change in the optimization process, we prove that the generalization error improves to \$\${\textbackslash}sqrt\{K/N\}\$\$. Our results imply that the compiling of unitaries into a polynomial number of native gates, a crucial application for the quantum computing industry that typically uses exponential-size training data, can be sped up significantly. We also show that classification of quantum states across a phase transition with a quantum convolutional neural network requires only a very small training data set. Other potential applications include learning quantum error correcting codes or quantum dynamical simulation. Our work injects new hope into the field of QML, as good generalization is guaranteed from few training data.},

However, the implementation of these developments requires a considerable programming effort, which has hindered their adoption. Here we describe i-PI, an interface written in Python that has been designed to minimise the effort required to bring state-of-the-art path integral techniques to an electronic structure program. While it is best suited to first principles calculations and path integral molecular dynamics, i-PI can also be used to perform classical molecular dynamics simulations, and can just as easily be interfaced with an empirical forcefield code.

We propose a general approach based on non-Markovian dynamical maps to extract this information from the initial trajectories and compress it into non-Markovian transfer tensors. Assuming time-translational invariance, the tensors can be used to accurately and efficiently propagate the state of the system to arbitrarily long time scales. The non-Markovian transfer tensor method (TTM) demonstrates the coherent-to-incoherent transition as a function of the strength of quantum dissipation and predicts the noncanonical equilibrium distribution due to the system-bath entanglement. TTM is equivalent to solving the Nakajima-Zwanzig equation and, therefore, can be used to reconstruct the dynamical operators (the system Hamiltonian and memory kernel) from quantum trajectories obtained in simulations or experiments. The concept underlying the approach can be generalized to physical observables with the goal of learning and manipulating the trajectories of an open quantum system.},

The good agreement between the optical spectra calculated for the inhomogeneous ensemble and the experimental data demonstrates that electrostatics is the dominant contributor to static disorder in site energies. Rotamers of polar amino acid side chains are found to cause bimodal distribution functions of site energy shifts, which can be probed by hole burning and single-molecule spectroscopy. When summing over the large number of contributions, the resulting distribution functions of the site energies become Gaussians, and the correlations in site energy fluctuations at different sites practically average to zero. These results demonstrate that static disorder in the FMO protein is in the realm of the central limit theorem of statistics.},

  abstract = {The fundamental ideas for a nonlocal density functional theory---capable of reliably capturing van der Waals interactions---were already conceived in the 1990s. In 2004, a seminal paper introduced the first practical nonlocal exchange--correlation functional called vdW--DF, which has become widely successful and laid the foundation for much further research. However, since then, the functional form of vdW--DF has remained unchanged. Several successful modifications paired the original functional with different (local) exchange functionals to improve performance, and the successor vdW--DF2 also updated one internal parameter. Bringing together different insights from almost 2 decades of development and testing, we present the next-generation nonlocal correlation functional called vdW--DF3, in which we change the functional form while staying true to the original design philosophy. Although many popular functionals show good performance around the binding separation of van der Waals complexes, they often result in significant errors at larger separations. With vdW--DF3, we address this problem by taking advantage of a recently uncovered and largely unconstrained degree of freedom within the vdW--DF framework that can be constrained through empirical input, making our functional semiempirical. For two different parameterizations, we benchmark vdW--DF3 against a large set of well-studied test cases and compare our results with the most popular functionals, finding good performance in general for a wide array of systems and a significant improvement in accuracy at larger separations. Finally, we discuss the achievable performance within the current vdW--DF framework, the flexibility in functional design offered by vdW--DF3, as well as possible future directions for nonlocal van der Waals density functional theory.},

In this complex, excitation energy transfer occurs between the bacteriochlorophyll a (BChl a) pigments. Two quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) studies, each with a different force-field and quantum chemistry approach, reported different excitation energy distributions for the FMO complex. To understand the reasons for these differences in the predicted excitation energies, we have carried out a comparative study between the simulations using the CHARMM and AMBER force field and the Zerner intermediate neglect of differential orbital (ZINDO)/S and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) quantum chemistry methods. The calculations using the CHARMM force field together with ZINDO/S or TDDFT always show a wider spread in the energy distribution compared to those using the AMBER force field. High- or low-energy tails in these energy distributions result in larger values for the spectral density at low frequencies. A detailed study on individual BChl a molecules in solution shows that without the environment, the density of states is the same for both force field sets. Including the environmental point charges, however, the excitation energy distribution gets broader and, depending on the applied methods, also asymmetric. The excitation energy distribution predicted using TDDFT together with the AMBER force field shows a symmetric, Gaussian-like distribution.},

A simple theoretical analysis establishes bounds and limiting behaviors. The contributions to purity from a purely incoherent term obtained from the diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix, a term associated with the difference of the two eigenstate populations, and a third term related to the square of the time derivative of a site population, are discussed in various regimes. In the case of tunneling dynamics from a localized initial condition, the complex interplay among these contributions leads to the recovery of purity under low-temperature, weakly dissipative conditions. Memory effects from the bath are found to play a critical role to the dynamics of purity. It is shown that the strictly quantum mechanical decoherence process associated with spontaneous phonon emission is responsible for the long-time recovery of purity. These analytical and numerical results show clearly that the loss of quantum coherence during the evolution toward equilibrium does not necessarily imply the decay of purity, and that the time scales relevant to these two processes may be entirely different.},

We point out that the symmetry of the initial condition confines the motion of the RDM elements to a one-dimensional subspace and show that the purity always goes through its maximally mixed value at some time during relaxation, but subsequently recovers and (under low-temperature, weakly dissipative conditions) can rise to values that approach unity. These behaviors are quantified through accurate path integral calculations. Under low-temperature, weakly dissipative conditions, we observe unusual, nonmonotonic population dynamics when the two-level system is initially placed in its ground state. We also analyze the origin of the system-bath interactions responsible for the nonmonotonic behavior of purity during relaxation. Our results show that classical dephasing processes arising from site level fluctuations lead to a monotonic decay of purity, and that the quantum mechanical decoherence events associated with spontaneous phonon emission are responsible for the subsequent recovery of purity. Last, we show that coupling with a low-temperature bath can purify a mixed two-level system. In the case of the maximally mixed initial RDM, the purity increases monotonically even during short time.},

Superconductivity is observed proximate to a metallic state with reduced isospin symmetry, but it remains unknown whether this is a coincidence or a key ingredient for superconductivity. Using a Hartree-Fock analysis and constraints from experiments, we argue that the symmetry breaking is inter-valley coherent (IVC) in nature. We evaluate IVC fluctuations as a possible pairing glue, and find that they lead to chiral unconventional superconductivity when the fluctuations are strong. We further elucidate how the inter-valley Hund's coupling determines the spin-structure of the IVC ground state and breaks the degeneracy between spin-singlet and triplet superconductivity. Remarkably, if the normal state is spin-unpolarized, we find that a ferromagnetic Hund's coupling favors spin-singlet superconductivity, in agreement with experiments. Instead, if the normal state is spin-polarized, then IVC fluctuations lead to spin-triplet pairing.},

  abstract = {We investigate the use of accurate path integral methods, namely the quasi-adiabatic propagator path integral (QuAPI) and the quantum-classical path integral (QCPI), for generating the memory kernel entering generalized quantum master equations (GQME). Our calculations indicate that the length of the memory kernel in system-bath models is equal to the full length of time nonlocality encoded in the Feynman--Vernon influence functional and that the solution of the GQME with a QuAPI kernel is identical to that obtained through an iterative QuAPI calculation with the same memory length. Further, we show that the memory length in iterative QCPI calculations is always shorter than the GQME kernel memory length. This stems from the ability of the QCPI methodology to pretreat all memory effects of a classical nature (i.e., those associated with phonon absorption and stimulated emission), as well as some of the quantum memory contributions (arising from spontaneous phonon emission). Furthermore, trajectory-based iterative QCPI simulations can fully account for important structural/conformational changes that may occur on very long time scales and that cannot be captured via master equation treatments.},

  abstract = {The time evolution of purity for an initially localized state of a symmetric two-level system coupled to a dissipative bath is investigated using numerically exact real-time path integral methods. With strong system-bath coupling and high temperature, the purity decays monotonically to its fully mixed value, with a short-time Gaussian behavior, which is subsequently followed by exponential evolution. However, under low-temperature and weak coupling conditions, a substantial recovery of purity is observed. A simple theoretical analysis reveals three contributions that correspond to a completely incoherent, eigenstate population difference and rate terms. The last two of these terms can counter the early drop of purity and are responsible for its rebound. These findings caution against using purity as a measure of decoherence in the dynamics of quantum dissipative systems.},

  abstract = {This paper provides an overview of some recent developments in quantum dynamic and spectroscopic calculations using the Chebyshev progagator. It is shown that the Chebyshev operator (Tk({\^H})) can be considered as a discrete cosine type propagator (cos(K{$\Theta$}{\textasciicircum})), in Which the angle operator ({$\Theta$}{\textasciicircum} = arccos {\^H}) is a single-valued mapping of the scaled Hamiltonian ({\^H}) and the order (k) is an effective time. Properties in the angle domain (thus in energy domain) can be obtained from those in the order domain via a cosine Fourier transform. The equivalence and parallelism between the order-angle formulation and the time-energy formulation allow one to transplant existing time-dependent quantum mechanical methods. Compared with the time propagator, the Chebyshev propagator has a number of numerical advantages. Because of its polynomial form, the action of the Chebyshev propagator can be evaluated exactly except for roundoff errors. The three-term recursion formula for Chebyshev polynomials is stable and requires minimal memory. The discretization error in time propagation can be avoided because the Chebyshev propagator is naturally disrcrete. Additional computational savings over the time propagation are possible because the Chebyshev wave packet can be propagated in the real space. Various applications of the Chebyshev propagator are discussed.},

  abstract = {X-ray transient absorption spectroscopy (XTAS) is a promising technique for measuring electron dynamics in molecules and solids with attosecond time resolutions. In XTAS, the elemental specificity and spatial locality of core-to-valence X-ray absorption is exploited to relate modulations in the time-resolved absorption spectra to local electron density variations around particular atoms. However, interpreting these absorption modulations and frequency shifts as a function of the time delay in terms of dynamics can be challenging. In this paper, we present a first-principles study of attosecond XTAS in a selection of simple molecules based on real-time time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT) with constrained DFT to emulate the state of the system following the interaction with a ultraviolet pump laser. In general, there is a decrease in the optical density and a blue shift in the frequency with increasing electron density around the absorbing atom. In carbon monoxide (CO), modulations in the O K-edge occur at the frequency of the valence electron dynamics, while for dioxygen (O2) they occur at twice the frequency, due to the indistinguishability of the oxygen atoms. In 4-aminophenol (H2NC6H4OH), likewise, there is a decrease in the optical density and a blue shift in the frequency for the oxygen and nitrogen K-edges with increasing charge density on the O and N, respectively. Similar effects are observed in the nitrogen K-edge for a long-range charge-transfer excitation in a benzene (C6H6)--tetracyanoethylene (C6N4; TCNE) dimer but with weaker modulations due to the delocalization of the charge across the entire TCNE molecule. Additionally, in all cases, there are pre-edge features corresponding to core transitions to depopulated orbitals. These potentially offer a background-free signal that only appears in pumped molecules.},

  abstract = {Water is vital to our everyday life, but its structure at a molecular level is still not fully understood from either experiment or theory. The latter is hampered by our inability to construct a purely predictive, first principles model. The difficulty in modeling water lies in capturing the delicate interplay among the many strong and weak forces that govern its behavior and phase diagram. Herein, molecular simulations with a recently proposed nonempirical quantum mechanical approach (the SCAN density functional) yield an excellent description of the structural, electronic, and dynamic properties of liquid water. SCAN (strongly constrained and appropriately normed)-based approaches, which describe diverse types of bonds in materials on an equal, accurate footing, will likely enable efficient and reliable modeling of aqueous phase chemistry. Water is of the utmost importance for life and technology. However, a genuinely predictive ab initio model of water has eluded scientists. We demonstrate that a fully ab initio approach, relying on the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) density functional, provides such a description of water. SCAN accurately describes the balance among covalent bonds, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals interactions that dictates the structure and dynamics of liquid water. Notably, SCAN captures the density difference between water and ice Ih at ambient conditions, as well as many important structural, electronic, and dynamic properties of liquid water. These successful predictions of the versatile SCAN functional open the gates to study complex processes in aqueous phase chemistry and the interactions of water with other materials in an efficient, accurate, and predictive, ab initio manner.},

By the use of Suzuki'sforward-time derivative operator to enforce the time-ordered exponential, we show that the same decomposition can be used to solve nonautonomous equations. In particular, odd-order algorithms are derived on the basis of a highly nontrivial time-asymmetric kernel. Such an operator approach provides a general and unified basis for understanding structure nonpreserving algorithms and is especially useful in deriving very high-order algorithms via analytical extrapolations. In this work algorithms up to 100th order are tested by integrating the ground-state wave function of the hydrogen atom. For such a singular Coulomb problem, the multi-product expansion shows uniform convergence and is free of poles usually associated with structure-preserving methods. Other examples are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Coupling between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom in Rhodamine 800 has been studied using fluorescence line narrowing (FLN) and three-pulse photon echo peak shift (3PEPS). From the FLN measurement we extract the Huang-Rhys S-factors and frequencies of 16 Franck-Condon active vibrations clustered in two groups centred around 350cm-1 and 1400cm-1. The five modes below 500cm-1 covered by the excitation pulse spectral band create a complex beating pattern in the 3PEPS measurements. After determining the reorganisation energy of the modes involved in the peak shift measurement we are able to obtain the S-factors of the modes. The S-factors from two different experiments are in good agreement. The dephasing rates of these vibrations deviate significantly from the band-gap law. We propose that the main channel for the dephasing of the modes above 225cm-1 is a second order process involving one phonon and a molecular vibration.},

At the same time, an efficient adaptation of these complexes to fluctuating light conditions is necessary to protect the diatoms against photodamage. So far, structural and dynamic data for the interaction between FCP and the photoprotective LHCX family of proteins in diatoms are lacking. In this computational study, we provide a structural basis for a remarkable pH-dependent adaptation at the molecular level. Upon binding of the LHCX1 protein to the FCP complex together with a change in pH, conformational changes within the FCP protein result in a variation of the electronic coupling in a specific chlorophyll-fucoxanthin pair, leading to a change in the exciton transfer rate by almost an order of magnitude. A common strategy for photoprotection between diatoms and higher plants is identified and discussed.},

Finally, exploiting the ability of the MQC-IVR to quantize different dofs to different extents, we present a detailed study of the extents to which quantizing the nuclear and electronic dofs improves numerical convergence properties without significant loss of accuracy.},

In previous work, we have shown that this ``sign problem'' can be mitigated using the modified Filinov filtration technique to control the extent to which individual modes of the system contribute to the overall phase of the integrand. Here, we follow this idea to a logical conclusion: we analytically derive a general expression for the mixed quantum-classical limit of the semiclassical correlation function---analytical mixed quantum-classical-initial value representation (AMQC-IVR), where the phase contributions from the ``classical'' modes of the system are filtered while the ``quantum'' modes are treated in the full semiclassical limit. We numerically demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the AMQC-IVR formulation in calculations of quantum correlation functions and reaction rates using three model systems with varied coupling strengths between the classical and quantum subsystems. We also introduce a separable prefactor approximation that further reduces computational cost but is only accurate in the limit of weak coupling between the quantum and classical subsystems.},

MQC-IVR employs a modified Filinov filtration (MFF) scheme to control the overall phase of the SC integrand, extending the applicability of SC methods to complex systems while retaining their ability to accurately describe quantum coherence effects. Here, we address questions regarding the effectiveness of the MFF scheme in combination with SC dynamics. Previous work showed that this filtering scheme is of limited utility in the context of semiclassical wavepacket propagation, but we find that the MFF is extraordinarily powerful in the context of correlation functions. By examining trajectory phase and amplitude contributions to the real-time SC correlation function in a model system, we clearly demonstrate that the MFF serves to reduce noise by damping amplitude only in regions of highly oscillatory phase leading to a reduction in computational effort while retaining accuracy. Further, we introduce a novel and efficient MQC-IVR formulation that allows for linear scaling in computational cost with the total simulation length, a significant improvement over the more-than quadratic scaling exhibited by the original method.},

Starting from the many-body expansion of the interaction energy, specific focus is on different classes of potential energy functions built upon a hierarchy of approximations and on their ability to accurately reproduce reference data obtained from state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations and experimental measurements. We show that most recent potential energy functions, which include explicit short-range representations of two-body and three-body effects along with a physically correct description of many-body effects at all distances, predict the properties of water from the gas to the condensed phase with unprecedented accuracy, thus opening the door to the long-sought ``universal model'' capable of describing the behavior of water under different conditions and in different environments.},

Our approach is based on four commutators similar to the ones we previously proposed for Wannier excitons. They allow us to calculate any physical quantity dealing with N excitons in terms of ``Pauli scatterings'' for carrier exchange in the absence of carrier interaction and ``interaction scatterings'' for carrier interactions in the absence of carrier exchange. We show that Frenkel excitons have a novel ``transfer assisted exchange scattering'', specific to these excitons. It comes from indirect Coulomb processes between localized atomic states. These indirect processes, commonly called ``electron-hole exchange'' in the case of Wannier excitons and most often neglected, are crucial for Frenkel excitons, as they are the only ones responsible for the excitation transfer. We also show that in spite of the fact that Frenkel excitons are made of electrons and holes on the same atomic site, so that we could naively see them as elementary particles, they definitely are composite objects, their composite nature appearing through various properties, not always easy to guess. The present many-body theory for Frenkel excitons is thus going to appear as highly valuable to securely tackle their many-body physics, as in the case of nonlinear optical effects in organic semiconductors.},

  abstract = {Since, up to now existing many-body theories for quantum particles were restricted to elementary fermions or elementary bosons, the treatment of interactions between composite quantum particles was only approximate. The many-body theory we describe in this Report thus constitutes a significant advance as it allows us to treat composite bosons made of two fermions as an entity, while dealing with their underlying fermionic components exactly. Pauli exclusion principle between fermions of two composite bosons appears through a set of dimensionless ``Pauli scatterings'' which correspond to fermion exchanges between composite bosons, in the absence of fermion interaction. In addition to these Pauli scatterings, composite bosons also have ``interaction scatterings'' in which composite bosons interact through the bare interactions of their elementary fermions, in the absence of fermion exchange. These two scatterings formally appear through a set of four commutators. They allow us to write any physical quantity dealing with N composite bosons in terms of these two scatterings. To visualize the physical processes which take place between composite bosons, new diagrams have been constructed. These are called ``Shiva diagrams''. They explicitly show all possible fermion exchanges taking place between any number N{$\geq$}2 of composite bosons: this is reasonable since the Pauli exclusion principle from which they originate is N-body in essence. Shiva diagrams also are quite valuable as they allow us to readily calculate any many-body effect between N composite bosons. While these ideas can be extended to more complicated composite quantum particles, in particular to composite fermions, the present work concentrates on composite bosons made of two fermions. Up to now, we have mostly used this formalism to study semiconductor excitons: along with hydrogen atoms, excitons are the simplest of all composite bosons --- just one electron and one hole with Coulomb interaction. The end of this report is dedicated to several problems dealing with excitons, to highlight how this new many-body theory can be used in practice.},

  abstract = {A common strategy to simulate mixed quantum-classical dynamics is by propagating classical trajectories with mapping variables, often using the Meyer--Miller--Stock--Thoss (MMST) Hamiltonian or the related spin-mapping approach. When mapping the quantum subsystem, the coupled dynamics reduce to a set of equations of motion to integrate. Several numerical algorithms have been proposed, but a thorough performance comparison appears to be lacking. Here, we compare three time-propagation algorithms for the MMST Hamiltonian: the Momentum Integral (MInt) (J. Chem. Phys., 2018, 148, 102326), the Split-Liouvillian (SL) (Chem. Phys., 2017, 482, 124--134), and the algorithm in J. Chem. Phys., 2012, 136, 084101 that we refer to as the Degenerate Eigenvalue (DE) algorithm due to the approximation required during derivation. We analyze the accuracy of individual trajectories, correlation functions, energy conservation, symplecticity, Liouville's theorem, and the computational cost. We find that the MInt algorithm is the only rigorously symplectic algorithm. However, comparable accuracy at a lower computational cost can be obtained with the SL algorithm. The approximation implicitly made within the DE algorithm conserves energy poorly, even for small timesteps, and thus leads to slightly different results. These results should guide future mapping-variable simulations.},

This paper explores application of the SQC/MM approach to the case of very weak non-adiabatic coupling between the electronic states, showing (as anticipated) how the standard SQC/MM approach used to date fails in this limit, and then devises a new SQC windowing scheme to deal with it. Application of this new SQC model to a variety of realistic benchmark systems shows that the new model not only treats the weak coupling case extremely well, but it is also seen to describe the ``normal'' regime (of electronic transition probabilities {$\greaterequivlnt$}\,0.1) even more accurately than the previous ``standard'' model.},

In this paper, the SQC/MM approach is used to treat energy transfer dynamics in site-exciton models of light-harvesting complexes, and in particular, the well-known 7-state Fenna--Mathews--Olson (FMO) complex. Again, numerically ``exact'' results are available for comparison, here via the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) approach of Ishizaki and Fleming, and it is seen that the simple SQC/MM approach provides very reasonable agreement with the previous HEOM results. It is noted, however, that unlike most (if not all) simple approaches for treating these systems, because the SQC/MM approach presents a fully atomistic simulation based on classical trajectory simulation, it places no restrictions on the characteristics of the thermal baths coupled to each two-level site, e.g., bath spectral densities (SD) of any analytic functional form may be employed as well as discrete SD determined experimentally or from MD simulation (nor is there any restriction that the baths be harmonic), opening up the possibility of simulating more realistic variations on the basic site-exciton framework for describing the non-adiabatic dynamics of photosynthetic pigment complexes.},

In this paper, a different classical electronic Hamiltonian for the treatment of electronically nonadiabatic processes is proposed (and ``quantized'' via the SQC windowing approach), which maps the dynamics of F coupled electronic states to a set of F spin-1/2 degrees of freedom (DOF), similar to the Fermionic spin model described by Miller and White (J. Chem. Phys. 1986, 84, 5059). It is noted that this spin-mapping (SM) Hamiltonian is an exact Hamiltonian if treated as a quantum mechanical (QM) operator---and thus QM'ly equivalent to the MM Hamiltonian---but that an analytically distinct classical analogue is obtained by replacing the QM spin-operators with their classical counterparts. Due to their analytic differences, a practical comparison is then made between the MM and SM Hamiltonians (when quantized with the SQC technique) by applying the latter to many of the same benchmark test problems successfully treated in our recent work with the SQC/MM model. We find that for every benchmark problem the MM model provides (slightly) better agreement with the correct quantum nonadiabatic transition probabilities than does the new SM model. This is despite the fact that one might expect, a priori, a more natural description of electronic state populations (occupied versus unoccupied) to be provided by DOF with only two states, i.e., spin-1/2 DOF, rather than by harmonic oscillator DOF which have an infinite manifold of states (though only two of these are ever occupied).},

Phys. 145, 144108 (2016)], an improved symmetrical quasi-classical (SQC) windowing model for the molecular dynamics treatment of electronically non-adiabatic processes was developed in order to extend the original SQC approach to the regime of weak-coupling between the electronic states. The improved SQC model---based on triangular-shaped window functions---handled the weak-coupling limit as intended and, as a bonus, was shown to be universally superior to the original square/histogram SQC windowing model over all coupling regimes, but only for treating systems of two electronic states, as no higher-dimensional generalization was evident. This paper, therefore, provides a generalized version for treating an arbitrary number of electronic states. By construction, the benefits of the two-state triangle model---seamless treatment of weak-coupling and improved accuracy in all coupling regimes---carry over to the generalized version. Far more significant, however, is that the new model provides vastly improved windowing statistics in higher dimensions, enabling the SQC simulation of electronically non-adiabatic processes involving many more relevant electronic states than was previously practical. Capabilities are demonstrated with respect to a 24 pigment trimer model of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson light-harvesting complex, as well as treating similar 48- and 96-electronic state model problems, illustrating the scaling properties of the new method.},

Calculations were performed using flat histogram windows and Gaussian windows over a range of width parameters. Use of the Wigner distribution function was also investigated as a possible choice. It was demonstrated for collinear H + H2 reactive scattering on the BKMP2 potential energy surface that reaction probabilities computed via the SQC methodology using a Gaussian window function of 1/2 unit width produces good agreement with quantum mechanical results over the 0.4--0.6 eV energy range relevant to the ground vibrational state to the ground vibrational state reactive transition.},

In the first 40 years (period 1), MPPT was largely ignored because the focus of quantum chemists was on variational methods. After the development of many-body perturbation theory by theoretical physicists in the 1950s and 1960s, a second 20-year long period started, during which MPn methods up to order n = 6 were developed and computer-programed. In the late 1980s and in the 1990s (period 3), shortcomings of MPPT became obvious, especially the sometimes erratic or even divergent behavior of the MPn series. The physical usefulness of MPPT was questioned and it was suggested to abandon the theory. Since the 1990s (period 4), the focus of method development work has been almost exclusively on MP2. A wealth of techniques and approaches has been put forward to convert MP2 from a O(M5) computational problem into a low-order or linear-scaling task that can handle molecules with thousands of atoms. In addition, the accuracy of MP2 has been systematically improved by introducing spin scaling, dispersion corrections, orbital optimization, or explicit correlation. The coming years will see a continuously strong development in MPPT that will have an essential impact on other quantum chemical methods. {\copyright} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

  abstract = {Nonadiabatic mixed quantum--classical (NA-MQC) dynamics methods form a class of computational theoretical approaches in quantum chemistry tailored to investigate the time evolution of nonadiabatic phenomena in molecules and supramolecular assemblies. NA-MQC is characterized by a partition of the molecular system into two subsystems: one to be treated quantum mechanically (usually but not restricted to electrons) and another to be dealt with classically (nuclei). The two subsystems are connected through nonadiabatic couplings terms to enforce self-consistency. A local approximation underlies the classical subsystem, implying that direct dynamics can be simulated, without needing precomputed potential energy surfaces. The NA-MQC split allows reducing computational costs, enabling the treatment of realistic molecular systems in diverse fields. Starting from the three most well-established methods---mean-field Ehrenfest, trajectory surface hopping, and multiple spawning---this review focuses on the NA-MQC dynamics methods and programs developed in the last 10 years. It stresses the relations between approaches and their domains of application. The electronic structure methods most commonly used together with NA-MQC dynamics are reviewed as well. The accuracy and precision of NA-MQC simulations are critically discussed, and general guidelines to choose an adequate method for each application are delivered.},

  abstract = {Dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) is an important intermediate in the atmospheric chemistry of nitrogen oxides. Although there has been much research, the processes that govern the physical interactions between N2O5 and water are still not fully understood at a molecular level. Gaining a quantitative insight from computer simulations requires going beyond the accuracy of classical force fields while accessing length scales and time scales that are out of reach for high-level quantum-chemical approaches. To this end, we present the development of MB-nrg many-body potential energy functions for nonreactive simulations of N2O5 in water. This MB-nrg model is based on electronic structure calculations at the coupled cluster level of theory and is compatible with the successful MB-pol model for water. It provides a physically correct description of long-range many-body interactions in combination with an explicit representation of up to three-body short-range interactions in terms of multidimensional permutationally invariant polynomials. In order to further investigate the importance of the underlying interactions in the model, a TTM-nrg model was also devised. TTM-nrg is a more simplistic representation that contains only two-body short-range interactions represented through Born--Mayer functions. In this work, an active learning approach was employed to efficiently build representative training sets of monomer, dimer, and trimer structures, and benchmarks are presented to determine the accuracy of our new models in comparison to a range of density functional theory methods. By assessing the binding curves, distortion energies of N2O5, and interaction energies in clusters of N2O5 and water, we evaluate the importance of two-body and three-body short-range potentials. The results demonstrate that our MB-nrg model has high accuracy with respect to the coupled cluster reference, outperforms current density functional theory models, and thus enables highly accurate simulations of N2O5 in aqueous environments.},

  abstract = {The role of pigment--protein coupling in the dynamics of photosynthetic energy transport in chromophoric complexes has not been fully understood. The excitation energy transfer in the photosynthetic system is tremendously efficient. In particular, we investigate the excitation energy transport in the Fenna--Matthews--Olson (FMO) complex. The exciton dynamics and excitation energy transfer (EET) depend on the interaction between the excited chromophores and their environment. Most theoretical models believe that all bacteriochlorophyll-a (BChla) sites are surrounded by the same local protein environment, which is contradicted by the structural analysis of the FMO complex. Based on different values of pigment--protein coupling for different sites, measured in the adiabatic limit, we have theoretically investigated the effect of the heterogeneous local protein environment on the EET process. By the realistic and site-dependent model of the system--bath couplings, the results show that this interaction may have a critical value for the coherent energy-transfer process. Furthermore, we verify that the two transport pathways are coherent and stable to the important parameter reorganization energy of environmental interactions. The quantum dynamical simulations show that the correlation fluctuation keeps the oscillation of the coherent excitation on a long timescale. In addition, due to the inhomogeneous pigment--protein coupling, different BChl sites have asymmetric excitation oscillation timescales.},

  abstract = {The exciton Hamiltonian of multichromophoric aggregates can be probed by spectroscopic techniques such as linear absorption and circular dichroism. To compare calculated Hamiltonians to experiments, a lineshape theory is needed, which takes into account the coupling of the excitons with inter- and intramolecular vibrations. This coupling is normally introduced in a perturbative way through the cumulant expansion formalism and further approximated by assuming a Markovian exciton dynamics, for example with the modified Redfield theory. Here, we present the implementation of the full cumulant expansion (FCE) formalism ( J. Chem. Phys. 142, 2015, 094106) to efficiently compute absorption and circular dichroism spectra of molecular aggregates beyond the Markov approximation, without restrictions on the form of exciton--phonon coupling. By employing the LH2 system of purple bacteria as a challenging test case, we compare the FCE lineshapes with the Markovian lineshapes obtained with the modified Redfield theory, showing that the latter presents a less satisfying agreement with experiments. The FCE approach instead accurately describes the lineshapes, especially in the vibronic sideband of the B800 peak. We envision that the FCE approach will become a valuable tool for accurately comparing model exciton Hamiltonians with optical spectroscopy experiments.},

  abstract = {The Born--Oppenheimer approximation underlies much of chemical simulation and provides the framework defining the potential energy surfaces that are used for much of our pictorial understanding of chemical phenomena. However, this approximation breaks down when the dynamics of molecules in excited electronic states are considered. Describing dynamics when the Born--Oppenheimer approximation breaks down requires a quantum mechanical description of the nuclei. Chemical reaction dynamics on excited electronic states is critical for many applications in renewable energy, chemical synthesis, and bioimaging. Furthermore, it is necessary in order to connect with many ultrafast pump--probe spectroscopic experiments. In this review, we provide an overview of methods that can describe nonadiabatic dynamics, with emphasis on those that are able to simultaneously address the quantum mechanics of both electrons and nuclei. Such ab initio quantum molecular dynamics methods solve the electronic Schr{\"o}dinger equation alongside the nuclear dynamics and thereby avoid the need for precalculation of potential energy surfaces and nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements. Two main families of methods are commonly employed to simulate nonadiabatic dynamics in molecules: full quantum dynamics, such as the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method, and classical trajectory-based approaches, such as trajectory surface hopping. In this review, we describe a third class of methods that is intermediate between the two: Gaussian basis set expansions built around trajectories.},

  abstract = {We investigate the use of different variational principles in quantum Monte Carlo, namely, energy and variance minimization, prompted by the interest in the robust and accurate estimation of electronic excited states. For two prototypical, challenging molecules, we readily reach the accuracy of the best available reference excitation energies using energy minimization in a state-specific or state-average fashion for states of different or equal symmetry, respectively. On the other hand, in variance minimization, where the use of suitable functionals is expected to target specific states regardless of the symmetry, we encounter severe problems for a variety of wave functions: as the variance converges, the energy drifts away from that of the selected state. This unexpected behavior is sometimes observed even when the target is the ground state and generally prevents the robust estimation of total and excitation energies. We analyze this problem using a very simple wave function and infer that the optimization finds little or no barrier to escape from a local minimum or local plateau, eventually converging to a lower-variance state instead of the target state. For the increasingly complex systems becoming in reach of quantum Monte Carlo simulations, variance minimization with current functionals appears to be an impractical route.},

Its key feature is a time-evolving block-decimation (TEBD) procedure to identify and dynamically update the relevant, conveniently small, subregion of the otherwise exponentially large Hilbert space. Potential applications of the TEBD algorithm are the simulation of time-dependent Hamiltonians, transport in quantum systems far from equilibrium and dissipative quantum mechanics. In this paper we translate the TEBD algorithm into the language of matrix product states in order to both highlight and exploit its resemblances to the widely used density-matrix renormalization-group (DMRG) algorithms. The TEBD algorithm, being based on updating a matrix product state in time, is very accessible to the DMRG community and it can be enhanced by using well-known DMRG techniques, for instance in the event of good quantum numbers. More importantly, we show how it can be simply incorporated into existing DMRG implementations to produce a remarkably effective and versatile `adaptive time-dependent DMRG' variant, that we also test and compare to previous proposals.},

  abstract = {We use matrix diagonalization in combination with real-time path integral methods to investigate the electronic eigenstates and exciton--vibration dynamics of model dendrimers with Frenkel exciton interactions between adjacent segments, which characterize structures composed of conjugated molecules. Even in the absence of an explicit energetic gradient in the electronic Hamiltonian, exciton couplings create a funnel through the eigenstate hierarchy that pulls the excitation energy away from the periphery. The competition between eigenstate structure and entropic considerations dictates the equilibrium distribution, which in small dendrimers at low temperatures tends to favor the core, shifting outward with increasing dendrimer size and thermal energy, although this distribution can be skewed back toward the core by increasing the exciton coupling between segments of the same generation. At high temperatures the distribution becomes classical, with all excited segments having the same population. Strong exciton--vibration coupling also shifts the equilibrium distribution in the classical direction. We find that the dynamics of excitation energy transfer is highly nontrivial and strongly affected by quantum mechanical effects. A positive value of the intrageneration coupling (regardless of the sign of the intergeneration coupling parameter) introduces a very slow component to the dynamics, which we attribute to electronic frustration. With exciton coupling, vibrational reorganization energy and thermal energy of approximately the same magnitude, the energy transfer dynamics is characterized by time scales that span 2 orders of magnitude. The rich dynamics that results from a single-parameter electronic Hamiltonian suggests a multitude of design possibilities for dendrimeric structures with a desirable function.},

The evolution of the state populations is then obtained from the short-time simulation results and the solution of the kinetic equations with the computed rate matrix. These expressions generalize the reactive flux method and its nonequilibrium version to multistate processes and show that even in the completely incoherent limit of rate kinetics, the time evolution of populations is governed by coherences. Further, we show that by virtue of detailed balance, the short-time values of the imaginary components of coherences fully determine the equilibrium populations.},

In particular, the spread, signs, and shapes of the coherence maps collectively characterize the state of the system and the nature of the dynamics, as well as the equilibrium state. The topology of the system is readily reflected in its coherence map. Rows and columns show the composition of quantum superpositions, and their filling indicates the extent of the surviving coherence. Linear combinations of imaginary RDM elements specify instantaneous population derivatives. The main diagonal comprises the incoherent component of the dynamics, while the upper/lower triangular areas give rise to coherent contributions that increase the purity of the RDM. In open systems, the coherence map evolves to a band surrounding the principal diagonal whose width decreases with increasing temperature and dissipation strength. We illustrate these behaviors with examples of 10-site model molecular aggregates with Frenkel exciton couplings, where the electronic states of each monomer are coupled to harmonic vibrational baths.},

In order to obtain an accurate value of the binding energy of Be2 from DMC calculations, it is necessary to employ trial functions that include excitations outside the valence space. Our best estimate DMC result for the binding energy of Be2, obtained by using configuration interaction trial functions and extrapolating in the threshold for the configurations retained in the trial function, is 908 cm-1, only slightly below the 935 cm-1 value derived from experiment.},

Next, the snapshots of classical molecular dynamics computations are clusterized and one reference configuration from each cluster is used to compute a reference spectrum. Local fluctuation effects within each cluster are then taken into account by means of the perturbed matrix model. The performance of the proposed approach is tested on the challenging case of the optical and chiroptical spectra of camphorquinone in methanol solution. Although further validations are surely needed, the results of this first study are quite promising also taking into account that agreement with experimental data is reached by just a couple of full quantum mechanical geometry optimizations and frequency computations.},

Due to recent developments in nanophotonics, exciton-cavity structures with very strong light-matter coupling rates can be fabricated. We show that in such structures, a regime emerges where the decoherence is completely suppressed due to decoupling of the dominant phonon process. Using a numerically exact tensor network approach, we perform calculations in this nonperturbative, non-Markovian dynamical regime. Here, we identify a strategy for reaching near-unity photon indistinguishability and also discover an interesting phonon dressing of the exciton-cavity polaritons in the high-Q regime, leading to multiple phonon sidebands when the light-matter interaction is sufficiently strong.},

These low ST gaps can ideally be leveraged toward energy applications but are hindered by the decreasing stability of the systems. Thus, there is the need to understand the ST gap of nonlinear polyacenes, which are markedly more stable than their linear counterparts. Here, we show that the ST gaps of the nonlinear polyacenes do not decrease with the system size and have no correlation with the HOMO--LUMO gaps or increased conjugation. The reason behind this is identified as the high multireference character of the triplet high-spin state. These unprecedented results are in stark contrast to the observations in linear polyacenes and are due to the combined effects of topology and geometrical factors.},

  abstract = {Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and related spectroscopies are powered primarily by the concentration of the electromagnetic (EM) fields associated with light in or near appropriately nanostructured electrically-conducting materials, most prominently, but not exclusively high-conductivity metals such as silver and gold. This field concentration takes place on account of the excitation of surface-plasmon (SP) resonances in the nanostructured conductor. Optimizing nanostructures for SERS, therefore, implies optimizing the ability of plasmonic nanostructures to concentrate EM optical fields at locations where molecules of interest reside, and to enhance the radiation efficiency of the oscillating dipoles associated with these molecules and nanostructures. This review summarizes the development of theories over the past four decades pertinent to SERS, especially those contributing to our current understanding of SP-related SERS. Special emphasis is given to the salient strategies and theoretical approaches for optimizing nanostructures with hotspots as efficient EM near-field concentrating and far-field radiating substrates for SERS. A simple model is described in terms of which the upper limit of the SERS enhancement can be estimated. Several experimental strategies that may allow one to approach, or possibly exceed this limit, such as cascading the enhancement of the local and radiated EM field by the multiscale EM coupling of hierarchical structures, and generating hotspots by hybridizing an antenna mode with a plasmonic waveguide cavity mode, which would result in an increased local field enhancement, are discussed. Aiming to significantly broaden the application of SERS to other fields, and especially to material science, we consider hybrid structures of plasmonic nanostructures and other material phases and strategies for producing strong local EM fields at desired locations in such hybrid structures. In this vein, we consider some of the numerical strategies for simulating the optical properties and consequential SERS performance of particle-on-substrate systems that might guide the design of SERS-active systems. Finally, some current theoretical attempts are briefly discussed for unifying EM and non-EM contribution to SERS.},

  abstract = {The general theory of quantum mechanics is now almost complete, the imperfections that still remain being in connection with the exact fitting in of the theory with relativity ideas. These give rise to difficulties only when high-speed particles are involved, and are therefore of no importance in the consideration of atomic and molecular structure and ordinary chemical reactions, in which it is, indeed, usually sufficiently accurate if one neglects relativity variation of mass with velocity and assumes only Coulomb forces between the various electrons and atomic nuclei. The underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical theory of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known, and the difficulty is only that the exact application of these laws leads to equations much too complicated to be soluble. It there fore becomes desirable that approximate practical methods of applying quantum mechanics should be developed, which can lead to an explanation of the main features of complex atomic systems without too much computation. Already before the arrival of quantum mechanics there existed a theory of atomic structure, based on Bohr's ideas of quantised orbits, which was fairly successful in a wide field. To get agreement with experiment it was found necessary to introduce the spin of the electron, giving a doubling in the number of orbits of an electron in an atom. With the help of this spin and Pauli's exclusion principle, a satisfactory theory of multiplet terms was obtained when one made the additional assumption that the electrons in an atom all set themselves with their spins parallel or antiparallel. If s denoted the magnitude of the resultant spin angular momentum, this s was combined vectorially with the resultant orbital angular momentum l to give a multiplet of multiplicity 2s + 1. The fact that one had to make this additional assumption was, however, a serious disadvantage, as no theoretical reasons to support it could be given. It seemed to show that there were large forces coupling the spin vectors of the electrons in an atom, much larger forces than could be accounted for as due to the interaction of the magnetic moments of the electrons. The position was thus that there was empirical evidence in favour of these large forces, but that their theoretical nature was quite unknown.},

Moreover, under thermal equilibrium, both quantum and classical simulations predict that the static dielectric constant of liquid water is largely unchanged inside vs outside the cavity. This result disagrees with a recent experiment demonstrating that the static dielectric constant of liquid water can be resonantly enhanced under VSC, suggesting either limitations of our approach or perhaps other experimental factors that have not yet been explored.},

Gaining atomic-level detail of how such changes occur has the potential to reveal these mechanisms and is of critical importance in identifying drug targets, facilitating rational drug design, and enabling bioengineering applications. While the past two decades have brought Markov state model techniques to the point where practitioners can regularly use them to glimpse the long-time dynamics of slow conformations in complex systems, many systems are still beyond their reach. In this Perspective, we discuss how including memory (i.e., non-Markovian effects) can reduce the computational cost to predict the long-time dynamics in these complex systems by orders of magnitude and with greater accuracy and resolution than state-of-the-art Markov state models. We illustrate how memory lies at the heart of successful and promising techniques, ranging from the Fokker--Planck and generalized Langevin equations to deep-learning recurrent neural networks and generalized master equations. We delineate how these techniques work, identify insights that they can offer in biomolecular systems, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages in practical settings. We show how generalized master equations can enable the investigation of, for example, the gate-opening process in RNA polymerase II and demonstrate how our recent advances tame the deleterious influence of statistical underconvergence of the molecular dynamics simulations used to parameterize these techniques. This represents a significant leap forward that will enable our memory-based techniques to interrogate systems that are currently beyond the reach of even the best Markov state models. We conclude by discussing some current challenges and future prospects for how exploiting memory will open the door to many exciting opportunities.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The time-dependent quantum mechanics of heavy particles moving on a single potential energy surface can often be represented surprisingly well by the evolution of classical trajectory ensembles. However, manifestly quantum mechanical phenomena---such as transitions between coupled electronic states, electronic coherence and its decay, or quantum mechanical tunneling---require fundamental modification of the purely classical motion. We introduced and developed an approach to this problem that is based on solving the quantum Liouville equation using ensembles of classical trajectories. In this article, we describe the general approach and its application to the problems of nonadiabatic dynamics, coherent multistate electronic--nuclear dynamics, and tunneling through potential barriers. When viewed from the trajectory ensemble perspective, quantum effects arise as a breakdown of the statistical independence of the trajectories in the ensemble and a nonlocal entanglement of their collective evolution. {\copyright} 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {The excited-state dynamics of organic molecules, molecular aggregates, and donor--acceptor clusters is typically governed by the interplay of electronic excitations and, due to their flexibility and soft bonding, by the interaction with their vibrations. This interaction in these systems can be characterized by a few relevant electronic states that are coupled to numerous vibrational normal modes, encompassing a vast configurational space of the molecules. The full quantum simulation of these type of systems has been long dominated by the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) approach and its multilayer variants, which are considered the gold standard in the presence of electron-vibration coupling with a large number of modes. Recently, also the matrix product state ansatz (MPS) with appropriate time-evolution schemes has been applied to these types of Hamiltonians. In this article, we provide a numerical comparison of excited-state dynamics between the MCTDH and MPS approaches for two electron-vibration coupled systems. Notably, we consider two models for exciton dissociation at a P3HT:PCBM heterojunction, comprising two electronic states and 100 vibrational modes, and 26 electronic states and 113 vibrational modes, respectively. While both methods agree very well for the first model, more pronounced deviations are found for the second model. We trace back the divergence between the methods to the different way entanglement is treated.},

In this paper, we present a hands-on discussion of the FSP and investigate in detail its manifestation with respect to temperature, system size, interaction-strength and -type, and the dimensionality of the system. Moreover, we analyze the probability distribution of fermionic expectation values, which can be non-Gaussian and fat-tailed when the FSP is severe. As a practical application, we consider electrons and dipolar atoms in a harmonic confinement, and the uniform electron gas in the warm dense matter regime. In addition, we provide extensive PIMC data, which can be used as a reference for the development of new methods and as a benchmark for approximations.},

  abstract = {We have revisited the 2D spectroscopy of the excitation energy transfer in the Fenna--Matthews--Olson (FMO) protein. Based on 2D spectroscopic signatures, the energy transfer dynamics in the FMO protein has been argued to be supported by long-lived electronic quantum coherence on timescales up to 1.5 ps. In contrast, our analysis, based on experimental data and confirmed by theoretical calculations, shows that the electronic decoherence occurs within 60 fs, in agreement with typical dephasing times in systems under these conditions. Given the relatively well-defined structure of the FMO protein, and comparative couplings between chlorophylls to other photosynthetic systems, the observed extremely fast decoherence should be viewed as general, bringing to question any significant quantum coherent transport contributions to photosynthesis.During the first steps of photosynthesis, the energy of impinging solar photons is transformed into electronic excitation energy of the light-harvesting biomolecular complexes. The subsequent energy transfer to the reaction center is commonly rationalized in terms of excitons moving on a grid of biomolecular chromophores on typical timescales \&lt;100 fs. Today's understanding of the energy transfer includes the fact that the excitons are delocalized over a few neighboring sites, but the role of quantum coherence is considered as irrelevant for the transfer dynamics because it typically decays within a few tens of femtoseconds. This orthodox picture of incoherent energy transfer between clusters of a few pigments sharing delocalized excitons has been challenged by ultrafast optical spectroscopy experiments with the Fenna--Matthews--Olson protein, in which interference oscillatory signals up to 1.5 ps were reported and interpreted as direct evidence of exceptionally long-lived electronic quantum coherence. Here, we show that the optical 2D photon echo spectra of this complex at ambient temperature in aqueous solution do not provide evidence of any long-lived electronic quantum coherence, but confirm the orthodox view of rapidly decaying electronic quantum coherence on a timescale of 60 fs. Our results can be considered as generic and give no hint that electronic quantum coherence plays any biofunctional role in real photoactive biomolecular complexes. Because in this structurally well-defined protein the distances between bacteriochlorophylls are comparable to those of other light-harvesting complexes, we anticipate that this finding is general and directly applies to even larger photoactive biomolecular complexes.},

  abstract = {In the primary step of natural light harvesting, the solar photon energy is captured in a photoexcited electron?hole pair, or an exciton, in chlorophyll. Its conversion to chemical potential occurs in the special pair reaction center, which is reached by downhill ultrafast excited-state energy transport through a network of chromophores. Being inherently quantum, transport could in principle occur via a matter wave, with vast implications for efficiency. How long a matter wave remains coherent is determined by the intensity by which the exciton is disturbed by the noisy biological environment. The stronger this is, the stronger the electronic coupling between chromophores must be to overcome the fluctuations and phase shifts. The current consensus is that under physiological conditions, quantum coherence vanishes on the 10-fs time scale, rendering it irrelevant for the observed picosecond transfer. Yet, at low-enough temperature, quantum coherence should in principle be present. Here, we reveal the onset of longer-lived electronic coherence at extremely low temperatures of ?20 K. Using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy, we determine the exciton coherence times in the Fenna?Matthew?Olson complex over an extensive temperature range. At 20 K, coherence persists out to 200 fs (close to the antenna) and marginally up to 500 fs at the reaction center. It decays markedly faster with modest increases in temperature to become irrelevant above 150 K. At low temperature, the fragile electronic coherence can be separated from the robust vibrational coherence, using a rigorous theoretical analysis. We believe that by this generic principle, light harvesting becomes robust against otherwise fragile quantum effects.},

These many body dynamics can be very expensive to simulate, and extracting finite-temperature results---which require running and averaging over many such simulations---becomes especially challenging. Here, we present numerical simulations that exploit a recent theoretical result that allows dissipative environmental effects at finite temperature to be extracted efficiently from a single, zero-temperature wave function simulation. Using numerically exact time-dependent variational matrix product states, we verify that this approach can be applied to vibronic tunneling systems and provide insight into the practical problems lurking behind the elegance of the theory, such as the rapidly growing numerical demands that can appear for high temperatures over the length of computations.},

  abstract = {The hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) provide a numerically exact approach for computing the reduced dynamics of a quantum system linearly coupled to a bath. We have found that HEOM contains temperature-dependent instabilities that grow exponentially in time. In the case of continuous-bath models, these instabilities may be delayed to later times by increasing the hierarchy dimension; however, for systems coupled to discrete, nondispersive modes, increasing the hierarchy dimension does little to alleviate the problem. We show that these instabilities can also be removed completely at a potentially much lower cost via projection onto the space of stable eigenmodes; furthermore, we find that for discrete-bath models at zero temperature, the remaining projected dynamics computed with few hierarchy levels are essentially identical to the exact dynamics that otherwise might require an intractably large number of hierarchy levels for convergence. Recognizing that computation of the eigenmodes might be prohibitive, e.g., for large or strongly coupled models, we present a Prony filtration algorithm that may be useful as an alternative for accomplishing this projection when diagonalization is too costly. We present results demonstrating the efficacy of HEOM projected via diagonalization and Prony filtration. We also discuss issues associated with the non-normality of HEOM.},

The temperature dependence of quantum coherence in a trimer complex (first three subunits of the Fenna--Matthews--Olson complex) is studied using a temperature-dependent quantum stochastic Liouville equation. In the non-Markovian limit, the lowering of temperature induces long-lasting quantum coherence that, in turn, leads to delocalization, whose length grows. The entanglement and coherence length determine the nature of the dynamic localization.},

  abstract = {Quantum coherence controls almost every aspect of static and dynamic response of a strongly correlated quantum system, although details of this control have not been elucidated in many cases. We find that, in the presence of a significant static off-diagonal coupling, quantum coherence can survive much longer than the bath correlation time in a noisy environment. In the presence of time correlated noise (non-Markovian limit), coherence could propagate through the excited bath states, and this plays a nontrivial role in giving rise to a noncanonical temperature dependence of population distribution in an extended conjugated polymer-like system. The quantum coherence through the excited bath states vanishes in the high temperature limit, giving rise to the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution. Second, we discuss a role of quantum coherence in exciton localization that bears resemblance to Anderson localization. Calculations have been carried out not only with a chain of conjugated polymer but also with dimer and trimer subunits of the Fenna--Matthews--Olson (FMO) complex. We derive an analytical expression of the relation between steady state coherence and excitionic population distribution. We analytically showed that steady state coherence in equilibrium bath states is governed by interchromophoric coupling (J) whereas coherence in excited bath states is dictated by fluctuation strength (Vd) for the spatially correlated bath model. For the spatially uncorrelated bath model, we observe that at the low temperature limit coherence in the excited bath states dominates over coherence in equilibrium bath states and vice versa. In the study of the localization problem, we analytically show that, in the limit of a negligibly small fluctuation rate (bd), the diffusion coefficient is exactly proportional to the fluctuation rate, leading to complete breakdown of the Haken--Strobl--Silbey Markovian prediction.},

  abstract = {This paper has two purposes: 1) to clarify the relationship between the quantum theory of radiation, where the electromagnetic field-expansion coefficients satisfy commutation relations, and the semiclassical theory, where the electromagnetic field is considered as a definite function of time rather than as an operator; and 2) to apply some of the results in a study of amplitude and frequency stability in a molecular beam maser. In 1), it is shown that the semiclassical theory, when extended te take into account both the effect of the field on the molecules and the effect of the molecules on the field, reproduces almost quantitatively the same laws of energy exchange and coherence properties as the quantized field theory, even in the limit of one or a few quanta in the field mode. In particular, the semiclassical theory is shown to lead to a prediction of spontaneous emission, with the same decay rate as given by quantum electrodynamics, described by the Einstein A coefficients. In 2), the semiclassical theory is applied to the molecular beam maser. Equilibrium amplitude and frequency of oscillation are obtained for an arbitrary velocity distribution of focused molecules, generalizing the results obtained previously by Gordon, Zeiger, and Townes for a singel-velocity beam, and by Lamb and Helmer for a Maxwellian beam. A somewhat surprising result is obtained; which is that the measurable properties of the maser, such as starting current, effective molecular Q, etc., depend mostly on the slowest 5 to 10 per cent of the molecules. Next we calculate the effect of amplitude and frequency of oscillation, of small systematic perturbations. We obtain a prediction that stability can be improved by adjusting the system so that the molecules emit all their energy h {\textohm} to the field, then reabsorb part of it, before leaving the cavity. In general, the most stable operation is obtained when the molecules are in the process of absorbing energy from the radiation as they leave the cavity, most unstable when they are still emitting energy at that time. Finally, we consider the response of an oscillating maser to randomly time-varying perturbations. Graphs are given showing predicted response to a small superimposed signal of a frequency near the oscillation frequency. The existence of "noise enhancing" and "noise quieting" modes of operation found here is a general property of any oscillating system in which amplitude is limited by nonlinearity.},

Focusing specifically on the case of liquid oxygen, we calculate the classical force-force time correlation function using a molecular dynamics simulation and then determine various approximations to the relaxation rate constant by applying the schemes considered earlier.

One ab initio method for solving the Schr{\"o}dinger equation that scales favorably for large systems is variational quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). The recently introduced deep QMC approach uses ansatzes represented by deep neural networks and generates nearly exact ground-state solutions for molecules containing up to a few dozen electrons, with the potential to scale to much larger systems where other highly accurate methods are not feasible. In this paper, we extend one such ansatz (PauliNet) to compute electronic excited states. We demonstrate our method on various small atoms and molecules and consistently achieve high accuracy for low-lying states. To highlight the method's potential, we compute the first excited state of the much larger benzene molecule, as well as the conical intersection of ethylene, with PauliNet matching results of more expensive high-level methods.},

We observe coherent oscillations of the Fe--CO bond distance with a period of 42\,fs and an amplitude of {$\sim$}1\,{\AA}. These nuclear motions induce pronounced geometric reorganization, which makes the CO dissociation irreversible. The reaction is initially dominated by symmetry breaking vibrations inducing an electron transfer from porphyrin to iron. Subsequently, the wavepacket relaxes to the triplet manifold in {$\sim$}75\,fs and to the quintet manifold in {$\sim$}430\,fs. Our results highlight the central role of nuclear vibrations at the origin of the ultrafast photodynamics of organometallic complexes.},

Theory and simulation play a crucial role in this task. Despite great advances in hardware and computational methods, the theoretical description of photoinduced phenomena in the presence of complex environments and external photoexcitation conditions still poses formidable challenges for theoreticians and there are numerous formal and computational difficulties that must be overcome. The development of predictive, accurate, and at the same time, computationally efficient theoretical approaches to describe complex problems in photochemistry and photophysics is an active field of research in contemporary theoretical and computational chemistry. In this advanced review, we discuss modern computational advances and novel approaches that have been recently developed in excited-electronic structure methods, and multiscale modeling, with a special emphasis on coupled electron-nuclear dynamics and spectroscopy, from fully quantum to semi-classical methodologies?including dissipative effects, the explicit light field interaction, femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopy, and software infrastructure.

  abstract = {Singlet fission (SF) involves the conversion of one excited singlet state into two lower excited triplet states and has received considerable renewed attention over the past decade. This Perspective highlights recent developments and emerging concepts of SF in solid-state crystalline materials. Recent experiments showed the crucial role of vibrational modes in speeding up SF, and theoretical modeling has started to define an optimal energetic landscape and intermolecular orientation of chromophores for highly efficient singlet fission. A critical analysis of these developments leads to directions for future research to eventually find singlet fission chromophores with excellent optoelectronic properties.},

  abstract = {We investigate the accuracy of the second-order time-convolutionless (TCL2) quantum master equation for the calculation of linear and nonlinear spectroscopies of multichromophore systems. We show that even for systems with non-adiabatic coupling, the TCL2 master equation predicts linear absorption spectra that are accurate over an extremely broad range of parameters and well beyond what would be expected based on the perturbative nature of the approach; non-equilibrium population dynamics calculated with TCL2 for identical parameters are significantly less accurate. For third-order (two-dimensional) spectroscopy, the importance of population dynamics and the violation of the so-called quantum regression theorem degrade the accuracy of TCL2 dynamics. To correct these failures, we combine the TCL2 approach with a classical ensemble sampling of slow microscopic bath degrees of freedom, leading to an efficient hybrid quantum-classical scheme that displays excellent accuracy over a wide range of parameters. In the spectroscopic setting, the success of such a hybrid scheme can be understood through its separate treatment of homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening. Importantly, the presented approach has the computational scaling of TCL2, with the modest addition of an embarrassingly parallel prefactor associated with ensemble sampling. The presented approach can be understood as a generalized inhomogeneous cumulant expansion technique, capable of treating multilevel systems with non-adiabatic dynamics.},

A new wave function is proposed here. The new value computed for {$\Delta$} is 11.5{$^\circ$}K. Qualitatively, the wave function suggests that the roton is a kind of quantum-mechanical analog of a microscopic vortex ring, of diameter about equal to the atomic spacing. A forward motion of single atoms through the center of the ring is accompanied by a dipole distribution of returning flow far from the ring. In the computation both the two-atom and three-atom correlation functions appear. The former is known from x-rays, while for the latter the Kirkwood approximation of a product of three two-atom correlation functions is used. A method is developed to estimate and correct for most of the error caused by this approximation, so that the residual uncertainty due to this source is negligible.},

  abstract = {A formalism has been developed, using Feynman's space-time formulation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics whereby the behavior of a system of interest, which is coupled to other external quantum systems, may be calculated in terms of its own variables only. It is shown that the effect of the external systems in such a formalism can always be included in a general class of functionals (influence functionals) of the coordinates of the system only. The properties of influence functionals for general systems are examined. Then, specific forms of influence functionals representing the effect of definite and random classical forces, linear dissipative systems at finite temperatures, and combinations of these are analyzed in detail. The linear system analysis is first done for perfectly linear systems composed of combinations of harmonic oscillators, loss being introduced by continuous distributions of oscillators. Then approximately linear systems and restrictions necessary for the linear behavior are considered. Influence functionals for all linear systems are shown to have the same form in terms of their classical response functions. In addition, a fluctuation-dissipation theorem is derived relating temperature and dissipation of the linear system to a fluctuating classical potential acting on the system of interest which reduces to the Nyquist-Johnson relation for noise in the case of electric circuits. Sample calculations of transition probabilities for the spontaneous emission of an atom in free space and in a cavity are made. Finally, a theorem is proved showing that within the requirements of linearity all sources of noise or quantum fluctuation introduced by maser-type amplification devices are accounted for by a classical calculation of the characteristics of the maser.},

  abstract = {Recent experiments and theory suggest that ground state properties and reactivity of molecules can be modified when placed inside a nanoscale cavity, giving rise to strong coupling between vibrational modes and the quantized cavity field. This is commonly thought to be caused either by a cavity-distorted Born--Oppenheimer ground state potential or by the formation of light--matter hybrid states, vibrational polaritons. Here, we systematically study the effect of a cavity on ground state properties and infrared spectra of single molecules, considering vibration-cavity coupling strengths from zero up to the vibrational ultrastrong coupling regime. Using single-mode models for Li--H and O--H stretch modes and for the NH3 inversion mode, respectively, a single cavity mode in resonance with vibrational transitions is coupled to position-dependent molecular dipole functions. We address the influence of the cavity mode on polariton ground state energies, equilibrium bond lengths, dissociation energies, activation energies for isomerization, and on vibro-polaritonic infrared spectra. In agreement with earlier work, we observe all mentioned properties being strongly affected by the cavity, but only if the dipole self-energy contribution in the interaction Hamiltonian is neglected. When this term is included, these properties do not depend significantly on the coupling anymore. Vibro-polaritonic infrared spectra, in contrast, are always affected by the cavity mode due to the formation of excited vibrational polaritons. It is argued that the quantized nature of vibrational polaritons is key to not only interpreting molecular spectra in cavities but also understanding the experimentally observed modification of molecular reactivity in cavities.},

The ubiquity of the ultrafast phase of solvation dynamics is demonstrated, and a discussion of its physical origin given. The slower phases of solvation vary strongly from solvent to solvent. Molecular theories of liquid dynamics are able to rationalize such variations over at least a 2000-fold range of time scale.

  abstract = {A time response over almost 5 decades (from 10-13 to about 10-8 s) to a (sub)picosecond laser pulse excitation has been observed in the Fenna, Matthews, and Olson (FMO) antenna protein trimer. The FMO protein is unique in having a fine-structured bacteriochlorophyll a Qy exciton absorption spectrum over the whole investigated temperature range between 6 and 160 K. As measured by a two-color pump-probe differential absorption, the population decay of the exciton states of seven strongly coupled bacteriochlorophyll a molecules in a protein monomer is the dominant dynamical process in the subpicosecond time domain. The through-band scattering takes a few picoseconds and depends only weakly on temperature, probably because of a low density of exciton states. At low temperatures, evidence for a slow pico-nanosecond relaxation process has also been obtained via time-dependent red-shift and broadening of the exciton emission spectrum. Two nonexclusive tentative interpretations to this effect have been provided. The phenomenon may be due to exciton solvation in the surrounding protein and water-glycerol matrix or/and due to slow scattering of closely spaced bacteriochlorophyll a exciton states in a protein trimer. The shape of the excited-state absorption spectrum (arising from transitions between singly and doubly excited exciton states) and its oscillator strength has been roughly estimated from the analysis of the pump-probe spectrum. The spectrum peaks at around 805 nm and is less featured compared to the ground-state absorption spectrum. Both spectra have comparable strength.},

  abstract = {Spectral characteristics of the optically excited states in the ring-shaped quasi-one-dimensional aggregates comprising 18 and 32 tightly coupled bacteriochlorophyll a molecules have been investigated using selective spectroscopy methods and theoretical modelling of the data. Distinguished by the lowest electronic transition energies in the LH2 and LH1 antenna complexes these aggregates govern the functionally important ultrafast funneling of solar excitation energy in the photosynthetic membranes of purple bacteria. It was found by using a sophisticated differential fluorescence line narrowing method that exciton--phonon coupling in terms of the dimensionless Huang--Rhys factor is strong in these systems, justifying an excitonic polaron theoretical approach for the data analysis. Although we reached this qualitative conclusion already previously, in this work essential dependence of the exciton--phonon coupling strength and reorganization energy on excitation wavelength as well as on excitation light fluence has been established. We then show that these results corroborate with the properties of excitonic polarons in diagonally disordered ensembles of the aggregates. Furthermore, the weighted density of states of the phonon modes, which is an important characteristic of dynamical systems interacting with their surroundings, was derived. Its shape, being similar for all studied circular aggregates, deviates significantly from a reference profile describing local response of a protein to the Qy electronic transition in a single bacteriochlorophyll a molecule. Similarities of the data for regular and B800 deficient mutant LH2 complexes indicate that the B800 pigments have no direct influence on the electronic states of the B850 aggregate system. Consistent set of model parameters was determined, unambiguously implying that excitonic polarons, rather than bare excitons are proper lowest-energy optical excitations in the LH1 and LH2 antenna complexes.},

  abstract = {A structure-based quantitative calculation of excitonic couplings between photosynthetic pigments has to describe the dynamical polarization of the protein/solvent environment of the pigments, giving rise to reaction field and screening effects. Here, this challenging problem is approached by combining the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method with the polarizable continuum model (PCM). The method is applied to compute excitonic couplings between chlorophyll a (Chl a) pigments of the water-soluble chlorophyll-binding protein (WSCP). By calibrating the vacuum dipole strength of the 0--0 transition of the Chl a chromophores according to experimental data, an excellent agreement between calculated and experimental linear absorption and circular dichroism spectra of WSCP is obtained. The effect of the mutual polarization of the pigment ground states is calculated to be very small. The simple Poisson-Transition-charge-from-Electrostatic-potential (Poisson-TrEsp) method is found to accurately describe the screening part of the excitonic coupling, obtained with FMO/PCM. Taking into account that the reaction field effects of the latter method can be described by a scalar constant leads to an improvement of Poisson-TrEsp that is expected to provide the basis for simple and realistic calculations of optical spectra and energy transfer in photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes. In addition, we present an expression for the estimation of Huang--Rhys factors of high-frequency pigment vibrations from experimental fluorescence line-narrowing spectra that takes into account the redistribution of oscillator strength by the interpigment excitonic coupling. Application to WSCP results in corrected Huang--Rhys factors that are less than one third of the original values obtained by the standard electronic two-state analysis that neglects the above redistribution. These factors are important for the estimation of the dipole strength of the 0--0 transition of the chromophores and for the development of calculation schemes for the spectral density of the exciton-vibrational coupling.},

  abstract = {Singlet fission is a spin-allowed process by which a singlet excited state is converted to two triplet states. To understand mechanisms of the ultrafast fission via a charge transfer (CT) state, one has investigated the dynamics through quantum-dynamical calculations with the uncorrelated fluctuation model; however, the electronic states are expected to experience the same fluctuations induced by the surrounding molecules because the electronic structure of the triplet pair state is similar to that of the singlet state except for the spin configuration. Therefore, the fluctuations in the electronic energies could be correlated, and the 1D reaction coordinate model may adequately describe the fission dynamics. In this work we develop a model for describing the fission dynamics to explain the experimentally observed behaviors. We also explore impacts of fluctuations in the energy of the CT state on the fission dynamics and the mixing with the CT state. The overall behavior of the dynamics is insensitive to values of the reorganization energy associated with the transition from the singlet state to the CT state, although the coherent oscillation is affected by the fluctuations. This result indicates that the mixing with the CT state is rather robust under the fluctuations in the energy of the CT state as well as the high-lying CT state.},

The need for numerical modeling is central for the understanding, control, and design of plasmonic and photonic nanostructures. Recently, the increasing sophistication of nanophotonic systems and processes, ranging from simple plasmonic nanostructures to multiscale and complex photonic devices, has been calling for highly efficient numerical simulation tools. This article reviews the state of the art in numerical methods for nanophotonics and describes which method is the best suited for specific problems. The widespread approaches derived from classical electrodynamics such as finite differences in time domain, finite elements, surface integral, volume integral, and hybrid methods are reviewed and illustrated by application examples. Their potential for efficient simulation of nanophotonic systems, such as those involving light propagation, localization, scattering, or multiphysical systems is assessed. The numerical modeling of complex systems including nonlinearity, nonlocal and quantum effects as well as new materials such as graphene is discussed in the perspective of actual and future challenges for computational nanophotonics.},

The classical-like dynamics of the overall system within these methods makes them computationally feasible, and they can be derived based on well-defined semiclassical approximations. However, the existence of a variety of different quasi-classical mapping Hamiltonian methods necessitates a systematic comparison of their respective advantages and limitations. Such a benchmark comparison is presented in this paper. The approaches compared include the Ehrenfest method, the symmetrical quasi-classical (SQC) method, and five variations of the linearized semiclassical (LSC) method, three of which employ a modified identity operator. The comparison is based on a number of popular nonadiabatic model systems; the spin-boson model, a Frenkel biexciton model, and Tully's scattering models 1 and 2. The relative accuracy of the different methods is tested by comparing with quantum-mechanically exact results for the dynamics of the electronic populations and coherences. We find that LSC with the modified identity operator typically performs better than the Ehrenfest and standard LSC approaches. In comparison to SQC, these modified methods appear to be slightly more accurate for condensed phase problems, but for scattering models there is little distinction between them.},

The methods compared are several variations of the linearized semiclassical (LSC) method, the symmetrical quasiclassical (SQC) method, and the mean-field (Ehrenfest) method. The comparison is performed in the context of a biexcitonic model and a seven-excitonic model of the Fenna--Matthews--Olson (FMO) complex.

An LLT has been rigorously proved in three empirically parametrized molecular models of water, and evidence consistent with an LLT has been reported for several other such models. In contrast, experimental proof of this phenomenon has been elusive due to rapid ice nucleation under deeply supercooled conditions. In this work, we combined density functional theory (DFT), machine learning, and molecular simulations to shed additional light on the possible existence of an LLT in water. We trained a deep neural network (DNN) model to represent the ab initio potential energy surface of water from DFT calculations using the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) functional. We then used advanced sampling simulations in the multithermal?multibaric ensemble to efficiently explore the thermophysical properties of the DNN model. The simulation results are consistent with the existence of an LLCP, although they do not constitute a rigorous proof thereof. We fit the simulation data to a two-state equation of state to provide an estimate of the LLCP?s location. These combined results?obtained from a purely first-principles approach with no empirical parameters?are strongly suggestive of the existence of an LLT, bolstering the hypothesis that water can separate into two distinct liquid forms.},

  abstract = {Abstract We develop a wave-function-based method for the simulation of quantum dynamics of systems with many degrees of freedom at finite temperature. The method is inspired by the ideas of Thermo Field Dynamics (TFD). As TFD, our method is based on the doubling of the system's degrees of freedom and thermal Bogoliubov transformation. As distinct from TFD, our method implements the doubling of thermalized degrees of freedom only, and relies upon the explicitly constructed generalized thermal Bogoliubov transformation, which is not restricted to fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom. This renders the present approach computationally efficient and applicable to a large variety of systems.},

From the later part of the previous century, pump--probe and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy provided an impressive amount of information. Being simple to grasp, these methods are well-understood and widely used by the photosynthesis research community. In the last fifteen years, two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy was developed. It has significant advantages over other methods, in particular higher temporal resolution available and higher signal-to-noise ratio. Even though it provides considerable opportunities in research, both its experimental realization and theoretical description are rather complicated, making it somewhat difficult to understand and apply. This makes an unfortunate gap in the community, with spectroscopy experts being able to use the technique, but sometimes lacking the relevant biological knowledge, while biologists having that knowledge are dubious about 2D spectroscopy due to the complexity of the approach. This publication is an attempt to fill this gap by providing an accessible introduction to the concepts, principles and possible applications of the 2D spectroscopy, aimed at the biologically trained members of the photosynthesis research community.},

  abstract = {The observables of multidimensional infrared spectroscopy may be calculated from nonlinear vibrational response functions. Fully quantum dynamical calculations of vibrational response functions are generally impractical, while completely classical calculations are qualitatively incorrect at long times. These challenges motivate the development of semiclassical approximations to quantum mechanics, which use classical mechanical information to reconstruct quantum effects. The mean-trajectory (MT) approximation is a semiclassical approach to quantum vibrational response functions employing classical trajectories linked by deterministic transitions representing the effects of the radiation-matter interaction. Previous application of the MT approximation to the third-order response function R(3)(t3, t2, t1) demonstrated that the method quantitatively describes the coherence dynamics of the t3 and t1 evolution times, but is qualitatively incorrect for the waiting-time t2 period. Here we develop an optimized version of the MT approximation by elucidating the connection between this semiclassical approach and the double-sided Feynman diagrams (2FD) that represent the quantum response. Establishing the direct connection between 2FD and semiclassical paths motivates a systematic derivation of an optimized MT approximation (OMT). The OMT uses classical mechanical inputs to accurately reproduce quantum dynamics associated with all three propagation times of the third-order vibrational response function.},

On the one hand, we exploit the hierarchy of inhomogeneous transfer tensors (TTs), which provides us with relevant information about the role of correlations between the system and the environment in the dynamics. The connection between the TT hierarchy and the CP-divisibility property is then investigated, by showing to what extent quantum Markovianity can be linked to a description of the open-system dynamics by means of the composition of one-step TTs only. On the other hand, we introduce the set of stochastic TT transformations associated with local measurements on the open system at different times and conditioned on the measurement outcomes. The use of the TT formalism accounts for different kinds of memory effects in the multi-time statistics and allows us to compare them on a similar footing with the memory effects present in non-monitored non-Markovian dynamics, as we illustrate on a spin-boson case study.},

Therefore, these methods can be improved significantly from a computational standpoint if the relative importance of each configuration in the ground and excited states of molecular/model systems can be learned using machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANNs). We have used neural networks to train the configuration interaction coefficients obtained from full configuration interaction and Monte Carlo configuration interaction methods and have tested different input descriptors and outputs to find the more efficient training techniques. These ANNs have been used to calculate the ground states of one- and two-dimensional Heisenberg spin chains along with Heisenberg ladder systems, which are good approximations of polyaromatic hydrocarbons. We find excellent efficiency of training and the model this trained was used to calculate the variational ground state energies of the systems.},

The ASR leverages the functionality of the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) to interface with external simulation codes and attain a high abstraction level. We provide a library of Recipes for common simulation tasks employing density functional theory and many-body perturbation schemes. These Recipes utilize the GPAW electronic structure code, but may be adapted to other simulation codes with an ASE interface. Being independent objects with automatic data provenance control, Recipes can be freely combined through Python scripting giving maximal freedom for users to build advanced workflows. ASR also implements a command line interface that can be used to run Recipes and inspect results.

In LHZ an infinite-range spin-glass is mapped onto the low energy subspace of a spin-1/2 lattice gauge model with quasi-local four-body parity constraints. This spin model can be emulated in a natural way with Rubidium and Caesium atoms in a bipartite optical lattice involving laser-dressed Rydberg--Rydberg interactions, which are several orders of magnitude larger than the relevant decoherence rates.

The success of GW can be attributed to many factors: favorable scaling with respect to system size, a formal interpretation for charged excitation energies, the importance of dynamical screening in real systems, and its practical combination with other theories. In this review, we provide an overview of these formal and practical considerations. We expand, in detail, on the choices presented to the scientist performing GW calculations for the first time. We also give an introduction to the many-body theory behind GW, a review of modern applications like molecules and surfaces, and a perspective on methods which go beyond conventional GW calculations. This review addresses chemists, physicists and material scientists with an interest in theoretical spectroscopy. It is intended for newcomers to GW calculations but can also serve as an alternative perspective for experts and an up-to-date source of computational techniques.},

In this paper, the working mechanism of a new kind of AEE-active luminogen, tetraphenylpyrazine (TPP) and its derivatives, is studied by first-principles calculations contrasting their pyrazine core with an inherent n {$\rightarrow$} {$\pi$}* transition. Our results indicate that the attachment of phenyl rings to the pyrazine core can change the n {$\rightarrow$} {$\pi$}* transition component to {$\pi$} {$\rightarrow$} {$\pi$}* via the electronic conjugated effect and evoke restriction of intramolecular motion (RIM) that is responsible for the AEE characteristics. Decoration of the TPP peripheries with electron-withdrawing CF3 groups hardly affects the electronic transition properties and barely improves the solid-state luminescence. Substitution of the peripheral phenyls with electron-donating OCH3 groups thoroughly opens up the radiative channel and greatly enhances the emission quantum efficiency. Moreover, CF3 and OCH3 substituents can respectively generate extra CH{$\cdots$}F/F{$\cdots$}F/CF{$\cdots\pi$} and CH{$\cdots$}O interactions, which could promote RIM and slow down the non-radiative decay process. The experimental results confirm the theoretical predictions well. The above modulation guideline can be summarized from a molecular picture: the phenyl attachment reduces the n {$\rightarrow\pi$}* transition component and evokes RIM, while the substituent decoration imparts altered electronic conjugation and promotes RIM. Our work not only offers valuable insight into AEE phenomena, but also provides a strategy for the rational design of efficient heterocycle-containing emitters.},

  abstract = {The XXZ model is a canonical model of quantum magnetism. In one dimension, this model is integrable and has ballistically moving quasiparticles; thus, energy spreads ballistically, but, surprisingly, spin transport can be diffusive or superdiffusive. Here, we show that spin transport is even richer in the presence of a magnetic field: Some fraction of the spin moves out ballistically, but the dynamical spin-structure factor decays with an anomalous, continuously varying exponent. A hitherto-unnoticed phase transition takes place at finite fields, separating ballistic from subballistic decay of local correlations. We analytically derive these results using generalized hydrodynamics and support our findings numerically. These anomalous exponents can readily be measured via the frequency and wavevector dependence of the spin conductivity. We compute the spin-structure factor of XXZ spin chains in the Heisenberg and gapped (Ising) regimes in the high-temperature limit for nonzero magnetization, within the framework of generalized hydrodynamics, including diffusive corrections. The structure factor shows a hierarchy of timescales in the gapped phase, owing to s-spin magnon bound states (``strings'') of various sizes. Although short strings move ballistically, long strings move primarily diffusively as a result of their collisions with short strings. The interplay between these effects gives rise to anomalous power-law decay of the spin-structure factor, with continuously varying exponents, at any fixed separation in the late-time limit. We elucidate the cross-over to diffusion (in the gapped phase) and to superdiffusion (at the isotropic point) in the half-filling limit. We verify our results via extensive matrix product operator calculations.},

The underlying numerical algorithms should operate only with a few quantities (that can be efficiently obtained from quantum chemistry), provide a controlled approximation (which can be systematically improved) and capture important phenomena such as branching (multiple products), detailed balance and evolution of electronic coherences. Here we propose a new algorithm based on Monte-Carlo sampling of classical trajectories, which satisfies the above requirements and provides a general framework for existing surface hopping methods for non-adiabatic dynamics simulations. In particular, our algorithm can be viewed as a post-processing technique for analysing numerical results obtained from the conventional surface hopping approaches.

The active noise has either Gaussian or non-Gaussian distribution but has a memory, accounting for the persistent motion of the active bath particles. This finite persistence makes the reconfiguration dynamics of the chain slow as compared to the purely thermal case and the chain swells. The active noise also results superdiffusive or ballistic motion of the tagged monomer. We present all the calculations in details but mainly focus on the analytically exact or almost exact results on the topic, as obtained from our group in recent years. In addition, we briefly mention important works of other groups and include some of our new results.

In this Letter, we show that the mapping between a molecular system under study and the model cannot be established in a self-consistent way, unless the system part of the potential is taken effectively harmonic. Mathematically, this implies that the mapping is not invertible. This ``invertibility problem'' is not dependent on the peculiarities of particular molecular systems and is rooted in the anharmonicity of the system part of the Caldeira--Leggett model potential.},

They show the relationship of Tully's widely used surface hopping algorithm with the ``exact'' prescription that cannot be applied when running each trajectory independently. They also bring out the connection of the consistency problem with the coherent propagation of the electronic wave function and the artifacts caused by coherent Rabi-type oscillations of the state probabilities in weak coupling regimes. A real molecule (azobenzene) and two ad hoc models serve as examples to illustrate the above theoretical arguments. Following a proposal by Truhlar's group [Zhu et al., J. Chem.

Here, we quantify the non-Markovianity associated with both overdamped and underdamped vibrations in terms of information flow between the bath and the system and compare this with the broadening and ellipticity of two-dimensional spectra. Using the Breuer Laine Piilo (BLP) measure, we link the well-known stochastic models for spectral lineshape with modern quantum information theory. Specifically, we study the effect of non-Markovianity in a system in contact with underdamped vibrations and examine the differences observed on increasing the damping to the overdamped limit. The open quantum system dynamics are evolved using the hierarchical equations of motion, efficiently terminated with a Markovian cutoff, where separate hierarchies are derived for the underdamped and overdamped environments. It is shown that the BLP measure is quantitatively correlated with the ellipticity of two-dimensional spectra and memory effects are more pronounced in underdamped environments, due to the long-lived feedback of information between the system and its bath, compared to overdamped environments. Environmental signatures in spectral lineshapes emerge as a result of information flow from the bath back into the system.},

Such highly structured environments give rise to long-lived bath correlations that induce complex dynamics which are very difficult to simulate. These difficulties are further aggravated when spatial correlations between different parts of the system are important. By modeling the dynamics of a pair of two-level quantum systems in a common, structured, environment we show that a recently developed general purpose numerical approach, the time-evolving matrix product operator, is capable of accurate simulation under exactly these conditions. We find that tuning the separation to match the wavelength of the dominant environmental modes can drastically modify the system dynamics. To further explore this behavior, we show that the full dynamics of the bath can be calculated directly from those of the system, thus allowing us to develop intuition for the complex dynamics observed.},

  abstract = {The method of dispersion correction as an add-on to standard Kohn--Sham density functional theory (DFT-D) has been refined regarding higher accuracy, broader range of applicability, and less empiricism. The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coefficients and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles. The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers (CN). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease by 15\%--40\% compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C6 coefficients also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface. For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10\%) weakens the interlayer binding. We propose the revised DFT-D method as a general tool for the computation of the dispersion energy in molecules and solids of any kind with DFT and related (low-cost) electronic structure methods for large systems.},

  abstract = {A density functional theory (DFT) based composite electronic structure approach is proposed to efficiently compute structures and interaction energies in large chemical systems. It is based on the well-known and numerically robust Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhoff (PBE) generalized-gradient-approximation in a modified global hybrid functional with a relatively large amount of non-local Fock-exchange. The orbitals are expanded in Ahlrichs-type valence-double zeta atomic orbital (AO) Gaussian basis sets, which are available for many elements. In order to correct for the basis set superposition error (BSSE) and to account for the important long-range London dispersion effects, our well-established atom-pairwise potentials are used. In the design of the new method, particular attention has been paid to an accurate description of structural parameters in various covalent and non-covalent bonding situations as well as in periodic systems. Together with the recently proposed three-fold corrected (3c) Hartree-Fock method, the new composite scheme (termed PBEh-3c) represents the next member in a hierarchy of ``low-cost'' electronic structure approaches. They are mainly free of BSSE and account for most interactions in a physically sound and asymptotically correct manner. PBEh-3c yields good results for thermochemical properties in the huge GMTKN30 energy database. Furthermore, the method shows excellent performance for non-covalent interaction energies in small and large complexes. For evaluating its performance on equilibrium structures, a new compilation of standard test sets is suggested. These consist of small (light) molecules, partially flexible, medium-sized organic molecules, molecules comprising heavy main group elements, larger systems with long bonds, 3d-transition metal systems, non-covalently bound complexes (S22 and S66{\texttimes}8 sets), and peptide conformations. For these sets, overall deviations from accurate reference data are smaller than for various other tested DFT methods and reach that of triple-zeta AO basis set second-order perturbation theory (MP2/TZ) level at a tiny fraction of computational effort. Periodic calculations conducted for molecular crystals to test structures (including cell volumes) and sublimation enthalpies indicate very good accuracy competitive to computationally more involved plane-wave based calculations. PBEh-3c can be applied routinely to several hundreds of atoms on a single processor and it is suggested as a robust ``high-speed'' computational tool in theoretical chemistry and physics.},

  abstract = {Abstract It is shown by an extensive benchmark on molecular energy data that the mathematical form of the damping function in DFT-D methods has only a minor impact on the quality of the results. For 12 different functionals, a standard ?zero-damping? formula and rational damping to finite values for small interatomic distances according to Becke and Johnson (BJ-damping) has been tested. The same (DFT-D3) scheme for the computation of the dispersion coefficients is used. The BJ-damping requires one fit parameter more for each functional (three instead of two) but has the advantage of avoiding repulsive interatomic forces at shorter distances. With BJ-damping better results for nonbonded distances and more clear effects of intramolecular dispersion in four representative molecular structures are found. For the noncovalently-bonded structures in the S22 set, both schemes lead to very similar intermolecular distances. For noncovalent interaction energies BJ-damping performs slightly better but both variants can be recommended in general. The exception to this is Hartree-Fock that can be recommended only in the BJ-variant and which is then close to the accuracy of corrected GGAs for non-covalent interactions. According to the thermodynamic benchmarks BJ-damping is more accurate especially for medium-range electron correlation problems and only small and practically insignificant double-counting effects are observed. It seems to provide a physically correct short-range behavior of correlation/dispersion even with unmodified standard functionals. In any case, the differences between the two methods are much smaller than the overall dispersion effect and often also smaller than the influence of the underlying density functional. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {A black-box type procedure is presented for the generation of molecule-specific, classical potential energy functions (force-field, FF) solely from quantum mechanically (QM) computed input data. The approach can treat covalently bound molecules and noncovalent complexes with almost arbitrary structure. The necessary QM information consists of the equilibrium structure and the corresponding Hessian matrix, atomic partial charges, and covalent bond orders. The FF fit is performed automatically without any further input and yields a specific (nontransferable) potential which very closely resembles the QM reference potential near the equilibrium. The resulting atomistic, fully flexible FF is anharmonic and allows smooth dissociation of covalent bonds into atoms. A newly proposed force-constant--bond-energy relation with little empiricism provides reasonably accurate (about 5--10\% error) atomization energies for almost arbitrary diatomic and polyatomic molecules. Intra- and intermolecular noncovalent interactions are treated by using well established and accurate D3 dispersion coefficients, CM5 charges from small basis set QM calculations, and a new interatomic repulsion potential. Particular attention has been paid to the construction of the torsion potentials which are partially obtained from automatic QM-tight-binding calculations for model systems. Detailed benchmarks are presented for conformational energies, atomization energies, vibrational frequencies, gas phase structures of organic molecules, and transition metal complexes. Comparisons to results from standard FF or semiempirical methods reveal very good accuracy of the new potential. While further studies are necessary to validate the approach, the initial results suggest QMDFF as a routine tool for the computation of a wide range of properties and systems (e.g., for molecular dynamics of isolated molecules, explicit solvation, self-solvation (melting) or even for molecular crystals) in particular when standard parametrizations are unavailable.},

Our analysis identifies those classical trajectories that contribute most significantly to the response function on different time scales. This finding motivates a procedure for computing the linear response function in which the interference between pairs of classical trajectories is treated approximately, resulting in an integral over a single average trajectory, as in a purely classical calculation.},

  abstract = {Establishing the fundamental chemical principles that govern molecular electronic quantum decoherence has remained an outstanding challenge. Fundamental questions such as how solvent and intramolecular vibrations or chemical functionalization contribute to the decoherence remain unanswered and are beyond the reach of state-of-the-art theoretical and experimental approaches. Here we address this challenge by developing a strategy to isolate electronic decoherence pathways for molecular chromophores immersed in condensed phase environments that enables elucidating how electronic quantum coherence is lost. For this, we first identify resonance Raman spectroscopy as a general experimental method to reconstruct molecular spectral densities with full chemical complexity at room temperature, in solvent, and for fluorescent and non-fluorescent molecules. We then show how to quantitatively capture the decoherence dynamics from the spectral density and identify decoherence pathways by decomposing the overall coherence loss into contributions due to individual molecular vibrations and solvent modes. We illustrate the utility of the strategy by analyzing the electronic decoherence pathways of the DNA base thymine in water. Its electronic coherences decay in ?30 fs. The early-time decoherence is determined by intramolecular vibrations while the overall decay by solvent. Chemical substitution of thymine modulates the decoherence with hydrogen-bond interactions of the thymine ring with water leading to the fastest decoherence. Increasing temperature leads to faster decoherence as it enhances the importance of solvent contributions but leaves the early-time decoherence dynamics intact. The developed strategy opens key opportunities to establish the connection between molecular structure and quantum decoherence as needed to develop chemical strategies to rationally modulate it.},

  abstract = {The relation between the solutions of the time-independent Schr{\"o}dinger equation and the periodic orbits of the corresponding classical system is examined in the case where neither can be found by the separation of variables. If the quasiclassical approximation for the Green's function is integrated over the coordinates, a response function for the system is obtained which depends only on the energy and whose singularities give the approximate eigenvalues of the energy. This response function is written as a sum over all periodic orbits where each term has a phase factor containing the action integral and the number of conjugate points, as well as an amplitude factor containing the period and the stability exponent of the orbit. In terms of the approximate density of states per unit interval of energy, each stable periodic orbit is shown to yield a series of {$\delta$} functions whose locations are given by a simple quantum condition: The action integral differs from an integer multiple of h by half the stability angle times ℏ. Unstable periodic orbits give a series of broadened peaks whose half-width equals the stability exponent times ℏ, whereas the location of the maxima is given again by a simple quantum condition. These results are applied to the anisotropic Kepler problem, i.e., an electron with an anisotropic mass tensor moving in a (spherically symmetric) Coulomb field. A class of simply closed, periodic orbits is found by a Fourier expansion method as in Hill's theory of the moon. They are shown to yield a well-defined set of levels, whose energy is compared with recent variational calculations of Faulkner on shallow bound states of donor impurities in semiconductors. The agreement is good for silicon, but only fair for the more anisotropic germanium.},

  abstract = {The phase integral approximation of the Green's function in momentum space is investigated for an electron of negative energy (corresponding to a bound state) which moves in a spherically symmetric potential. If the propagator rather than the wavefunction is considered, all classical orbits enter into the formulas, rather than only the ones which satisfy certain quantum conditions, and the separation of variables can be avoided. The distinction between classically accessible and classically inaccessible regions does not arise in momentum space, because any two momenta can be connected by a classical trajectory of given negative energy for a typical atomic potential. Three approaches are discussed: the Fourier transform of the phase integral approximation in coordinate space, the approximate solution of Schr{\"o}dinger's equation in momentum space by a WKB ansatz, and taking the limit of small Planck's quantum in the Feynman-type functional integral which was recently proposed by Garrod for the energy-momentum representation. In particular, the last procedure is used to obtain the phase jumps of {$\pi$}/2 which occur every time neighboring classical trajectories cross one another. These extra phase factors are directly related to the signature of the second variation for the action function, and provide a physical application of Morse's calculus of variation in the large. The phase integral approximation in momentum space is then applied to the Coulomb potential. The location of the poles on the negative energy axis gives the Bohr formula for the bound-state energies, and the residues of the approximate Green's function are shown to yield all the exact wavefunctions for the bound states of the hydrogen atom.},

  abstract = {Simulations of photochemical reaction dynamics have been a challenge to the theoretical chemistry community for some time. In an effort to determine the predictive character of current approaches, we predict the results of an upcoming ultrafast diffraction experiment on the photodynamics of cyclobutanone after excitation to the lowest lying Rydberg state (S2). A picosecond of nonadiabatic dynamics is described with ab~initio multiple spawning. We use both time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and equation-of-motion coupled cluster singles and doubles (EOM-CCSD) theory for the underlying electronic structure theory. We find that the lifetime of the S2 state is more than a picosecond (with both TDDFT and EOM-CCSD). The predicted ultrafast electron diffraction spectrum exhibits numerous structural features, but weak time dependence over the course of the simulations.},

The nuclear--electronic orbital (NEO) approach treats specified nuclei, typically protons, quantum mechanically on the same level as the electrons with wave function and density functional theory methods. This approach inherently includes nuclear delocalization and zero-point energy in molecular energy calculations, geometry optimizations, reaction paths, and dynamics. It can also provide accurate descriptions of excited electronic, vibrational, and vibronic states as well as nuclear tunneling and nonadiabatic dynamics. Nonequilibrium nuclear--electronic dynamics simulations beyond the Born--Oppenheimer approximation can be used to investigate a wide range of excited state processes. This Perspective provides an overview of the foundational NEO methods and enumerates the prospects for using these methods as building blocks for future developments. The conceptual simplicity and computational efficiency of the NEO approach will enhance its accessibility and applicability to diverse chemical and biological systems.},

We use full classical mechanical molecular dynamics for the heavy atom degrees of freedom, including the solvent molecules, and treat the hydrogen motion quantum mechanically. We identify new obstacles that arise in this application of MDQT and present methods for overcoming them. We implement these new methods to demonstrate that application of MDQT to proton transfer in solution is computationally feasible and appears capable of accurately incorporating quantum mechanical phenomena such as tunneling and isotope effects. As an initial application of the method, we employ a model used previously by Azzouz and Borgis to represent the proton transfer reaction AH--B\ding{110}A---H+B in liquid methyl chloride, where the AH--B complex corresponds to a typical phenol--amine complex. We have chosen this model, in part, because it exhibits both adiabatic and diabatic behavior, thereby offering a stringent test of the theory. MDQT proves capable of treating both limits, as well as the intermediate regime. Up to four quantum states were included in this simulation, and the method can easily be extended to include additional excited states, so it can be applied to a wide range of processes, such as photoassisted tunneling. In addition, this method is not perturbative, so trajectories can be continued after the barrier is crossed to follow the subsequent dynamics.},

These methods range from a simple sum over atoms, to addition of bond energies, to pairwise interatomic force fields, reaching to the more sophisticated machine learning approaches that are capable of describing collective interactions between many atoms or bonds. In the case of equilibrium molecular geometries, even simple pairwise force fields demonstrate prediction accuracy comparable to benchmark energies calculated using density functional theory with hybrid exchange-correlation functionals; however, accounting for the collective many-body interactions proves to be essential for approaching the ``holy grail'' of chemical accuracy of 1 kcal/mol for both equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium geometries. This remarkable accuracy is achieved by a vectorized representation of molecules (so-called Bag of Bonds model) that exhibits strong nonlocality in chemical space. In addition, the same representation allows us to predict accurate electronic properties of molecules, such as their polarizability and molecular frontier orbital energies.},

Embedded in transmembrane protein complexes, they are responsible for the primary processes of photosynthesis: excitation energy and charge transfer. Here, we use ab initio many-body perturbation theory within the GW approximation and Bethe--Salpeter equation (BSE) approach to calculate the electronic structure and optical excitations of bacteriochlorophylls a, b, c, d, and e and chlorophylls a and b. We systematically study the effects of the structure, basis set size, partial self-consistency in GW, and the underlying exchange--correlation approximation and compare our calculations with results from time-dependent density functional theory, multireference RASPT2, and experimental literature results. We find that optical excitations calculated with GW+BSE are in excellent agreement with experimental data, with an average deviation of less than 100 meV for the first three bright excitations of the entire family of (bacterio)chlorophylls. Contrary to state-of-the-art time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) with an optimally tuned range-separated hybrid functional, this accuracy is achieved in a parameter-free approach. Moreover, GW+BSE predicts the energy differences between the low-energy excitations correctly and eliminates spurious charge transfer states that TDDFT with (semi)local approximations is known to produce. Our study provides accurate reference results and highlights the potential of the GW+BSE approach for the simulation of larger pigment complexes.},

In this paper, we employ pseudospectral sampling of time-dependent Gaussian basis functions for the simulation of non-adiabatic dynamics. Unlike other methods, the pseudospectral Gaussian molecular dynamics tests the Schr{\"o}dinger equation with N Dirac delta functions located at the centers of the Gaussian functions reducing the scaling of potential energy evaluations from  O  (   N   2   )   to  O  ( N )  . By projecting the Gaussian basis onto discrete points in space, the method is capable of efficiently and quantitatively describing the nonadiabatic population transfer and intra-surface quantum coherence. We investigate three model systems: the photodissociation of three coupled Morse oscillators, the bound state dynamics of two coupled Morse oscillators, and a two-dimensional model for collinear triatomic vibrational dynamics. In all cases, the pseudospectral Gaussian method is in quantitative agreement with numerically exact calculations. The results are promising for nonadiabatic molecular dynamics in molecular systems where strongly correlated ground or excited states require expensive electronic structure calculations.},

In this paper, we introduce a pseudospectral Gaussian-based method that achieves accurate quantum dynamics using efficient, real-space sampling of the time-dependent basis set. As in other Gaussian basis methods, we begin with a basis set expansion using time-dependent Gaussian basis functions guided by classical mechanics. Unlike other Gaussian methods but characteristic of the pseudospectral and collocation methods, the basis set is tested with N Dirac delta functions, where N is the number of basis functions, rather than using the basis function as test functions. As a result, the integration for matrix elements is reduced to function evaluation. Pseudospectral Gaussian dynamics only requires  O  ( N )   potential energy calculations, in contrast to  O  (   N   2   )   evaluations in a variational calculation. The classical trajectories allow small basis sets to sample high-dimensional potentials. Applications are made to diatomic oscillations in a Morse potential and a generalized version of the Henon-Heiles potential in two, four, and six dimensions. Comparisons are drawn to full analytical evaluation of potential energy integrals (variational) and the bra-ket averaged Taylor (BAT) expansion, an  O  ( N )   approximation used in Gaussian-based dynamics. In all cases, the pseudospectral Gaussian method is competitive with full variational calculations that require a global, analytical, and integrable potential energy surface. Additionally, the BAT breaks down when quantum mechanical coherence is particularly strong (i.e., barrier reflection in the Morse oscillator). The ability to obtain variational accuracy using only the potential energy at discrete points makes the pseudospectral Gaussian method a promising avenue for on-the-fly dynamics, where electronic structure calculations become computationally significant.},

Among the current approaches, directed message-passing neural networks (D-MPNNs) have proven to perform well on a variety of property prediction tasks. The software package Chemprop implements the D-MPNN architecture and offers simple, easy, and fast access to machine-learned molecular properties. Compared to its initial version, we present a multitude of new Chemprop functionalities such as the support of multimolecule properties, reactions, atom/bond-level properties, and spectra. Further, we incorporate various uncertainty quantification and calibration methods along with related metrics as well as pretraining and transfer learning workflows, improved hyperparameter optimization, and other customization options concerning loss functions or atom/bond features. We benchmark D-MPNN models trained using Chemprop with the new reaction, atom-level, and spectra functionality on a variety of property prediction data sets, including MoleculeNet and SAMPL, and observe state-of-the-art performance on the prediction of water-octanol partition coefficients, reaction barrier heights, atomic partial charges, and absorption spectra.

In contrast to molecular properties, where machine learning approaches such as graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have excelled for a wide variety of tasks, no general and transferable adaptations of GCNNs for reactions have been developed yet. We therefore combined a popular cheminformatics reaction representation, the so-called condensed graph of reaction (CGR), with a recent GCNN architecture to arrive at a versatile, robust, and compact deep learning model. The CGR is a superposition of the reactant and product graphs of a chemical reaction and thus an ideal input for graph-based machine learning approaches. The model learns to create a data-driven, task-dependent reaction embedding that does not rely on expert knowledge, similar to current molecular GCNNs. Our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art models in accuracy, is applicable even to imbalanced reactions, and possesses excellent predictive capabilities for diverse target properties, such as activation energies, reaction enthalpies, rate constants, yields, or reaction classes. We furthermore curated a large set of atom-mapped reactions along with their target properties, which can serve as benchmark data sets for future work. All data sets and the developed reaction GCNN model are available online, free of charge, and open source.},

Trapping of excitations, created at the periphery of the dendrimer, on a trap located at its core, is used as a probe of the efficiency of the energy transport across the dendrimer. The transport process is treated as incoherent hopping of excitations between nearest-neighbor dendrimer units and is described using a rate equation. We account for radiative and nonradiative decay of the excitations while diffusing across the dendrimer. We derive exact expressions for the Laplace transform of the trapping time distribution and the efficiency of trapping, and analyze those for various realizations of the energy bias, number of dendrimer generations, and relative rates for decay and hopping. We show that the essential parameter that governs the trapping efficiency is the product of the on-site excitation decay rate and the trapping time (mean first passage time) in the absence of decay.},

In this Letter, we consider the range of ionization energies and whether interfacial electric fields of a microdroplet can feasibly overcome the high energy step from hydroxide ions (OH--) to hydroxyl radicals (OH{$\bullet$}) in a primary H2O2 mechanism. We find that the vertical ionization energies (VIEs) of partially solvated OH-- ions are greatly lowered relative to the average VIE in the bulk liquid, unlike the case of the Cl-- anion which shows no reduction in the VIEs regardless of solvation environment. Overall reduced hydrogen-bonding and undercoordination of OH-- are structural features that are more readily present at the air--water interface, where the energy scale for ionization can be matched by statistically probable electric field values.},

Paradoxically, the states which are most localized and particlelike in the classical limit (wave packets) are not eigenfunctions of Hermitian observables, and have been omitted from asymptotic, formal theories of the semiclassical limit. When incorporated into a generalized theory, the Gaussian wave packet states apppear to alleviate many of the practical difficulties encountered in implementation of the Hermitian, delocalized state formulation.

A Gaussian form for the wave packets is assumed and equations of motion are derived for the parameters characterizing the Gaussians. If the potential (which may be nonseparable in many coordinates) is expanded in a Taylor series about the instantaneous center of the (many-particle) wave packet, and up to quadratic terms are kept, we find the classical parameters of the wave packet (positions, momenta) obey Hamilton's equation of motion. Quantum parameters (wave packet spread, phase factor, correlation terms, etc.) obey similar first order quantum equations. The center of the wave packet is shown to acquire a phase equal to the action integral along the classical path. State-specific quantum information is obtained from the wave packet trajectories by use of the superposition principle and projection techniques. Successful numerical application is made to the collinear He + H2 system widely used as a test case. Classically forbidden transitions are accounted for and obtained in the same manner as the classically allowed transitions; turning points present no difficulties and flux is very nearly conserved.},

The generalization takes the form of a discrete phase space path ``integral'' or sum. A complete set of gaussian phase space localized basis functions is proposed, and in the semiclassical limit, each basis function time develops in a simple classical-like fashion. Thus, the formulation conveniently builds in the correct limiting semiclassical behavior. The phase space path sum is formally exact, numerically it appears convenient, and is apparently equally at home in quantum and semiclassical regimes.},

However, by selective resummation of terms in the Wigner--Moyal series for the quantum phase space propagation it is possible to arrive at a revised or renormalized classicallike dynamics which solves the difficulties of the direct approach. In this paper, we review the Wigner method, qualitatively introduce the difficulties encountered in certain semiclassical applications, and derive quantitative means of surmounting these difficulties.

  abstract = {In the present work, we describe a more accurate and efficient variant of the chain-of-spheres algorithm (COSX) for exchange matrix computations. Higher accuracy for the numerical integration is obtained with new grids that were developed using global optimization techniques. With our new default grids, the average absolute energy errors are much lower than 0.1 kcal/mol, which is desirable to achieve ``chemical accuracy.'' Although the size of the new grids is increased by roughly a factor of 2.5, the excellent efficiency of the original COSX implementation is still further improved in most cases. The evaluation of the analytic electrostatic potential integrals was significantly accelerated by a new implementation of rolled-out versions of the Dupuis--Rys--King and Head-Gordon--Pople algorithms. Compared to our earlier implementation, a twofold speedup is obtained for the frequently used triple-{$\zeta$} basis sets, while up to a 16-fold speedup is observed for quadruple-{$\zeta$} basis sets. These large gains are a consequence of both the more efficient integral evaluation and the intermediate exchange matrix computation in a partially contracted basis when generally contracted shells occur. With our new RIJCOSX implementation, we facilitate accurate self-consistent field (SCF) binding energy calculations on a large supra-molecular complex composed of 320 atoms. The binding-energy errors with respect to the fully analytic results are well below 0.1 kcal/mol~for the cc-pV(T/Q)Z basis sets and even smaller than for RIJ with fully analytic exchange. At the same time, our RIJCOSX SCF calculation even with the cc-pVQZ basis and the finest grid is 21 times faster than the fully analytic calculation.},

We use the triangle window (TW) function and the CPS mapping kernel element to formulate a novel useful representation of discrete electronic degrees of freedom (DOFs). When it is employed with nonadiabatic field (NaF) dynamics, a new variant of the NaF approach (i.e., NaF-TW) is proposed. The NaF-TW expression of the population of any adiabatic state is always positive semidefinite. Extensive benchmark tests of model systems in both the condensed phase and gas phase demonstrate that the NaF-TW approach is able to faithfully capture the dynamical interplay between electronic and nuclear DOFs in a broad region, including where the states remain coupled all the time, as well as where the bifurcation characteristic of nuclear motion is important.},

The semiclassical approximation is employed for the quantum propagator and the stationary phase approximation for certain integrals is utilized in this derivation. This analysis demonstrates that the divergence of the classical trajectories associated with the individual gaussian packets accounts for the changes in shape of the quantum wavefunction or density, as has been suggested on intuitive grounds by Heller. The method should be exact for quadratic potentials and this is verified by explicitly applying it for the harmonic oscillator example.},

This review outlines advances made in understanding the relationship between aggregate structure and photophysics when vibronic coupling and intermolecular charge transfer are incorporated. An assortment of packing geometries is considered from the humble molecular dimer to more exotic structures including linear and bent aggregates, two-dimensional herringbone and "HJ" aggregates, and chiral aggregates.

  abstract = {ConspectusThe transport and photophysical properties of organic molecular aggregates, films, and crystals continue to receive widespread attention, driven mainly by expanding commercial applications involving display and wearable technologies as well as the promise of efficient, large-area solar cells. The main blueprint for understanding how molecular packing impacts photophysical properties was drafted over five decades ago by Michael Kasha. Kasha showed that the Coulombic coupling between two molecules, as determined by the alignment of their transition dipoles, induces energetic shifts in the main absorption spectral peak and changes in the radiative decay rate when compared to uncoupled molecules. In H-aggregates, the transition dipole moments align ``side-by-side'' leading to a spectral blue-shift and suppressed radiative decay rate, while in J-aggregates, the transition dipole moments align ``head-to-tail'' leading to a spectral red-shift and an enhanced radiative decay rate. Although many examples of H- and J-aggregates have been discovered, there are also many ``unconventional'' aggregates, which are not understood within the confines of Kasha's theory. Examples include nanopillars of 7,8,15,16-tetraazaterrylene, as well as several perylene-based dyes, which exhibit so-called H- to J-aggregate transformations. Such aggregates are typically characterized by significant wave function overlap between neighboring molecular orbitals as a result of small ({$\sim$}4 {\AA}) intermolecular distances, such as those found in rylene {$\pi$}-stacks and oligoacene herringbone lattices. Wave function overlap facilitates charge-transfer which creates an effective short-range exciton coupling that can also induce J- or H-aggregate behavior, depending on the sign.Unlike Coulomb coupling, short-range coupling is extremely sensitive to small (sub-{\AA}) transverse displacements between neighboring chromophores. For perylene chromophores, the sign of the short-range coupling changes several times as two molecules are ``slipped'' from a ``side-by-side'' to ``head-to-tail'' configuration, in marked contrast to the sign of the Coulomb coupling, which changes only once. Such sensitivity allows J- to H-aggregate interconversions over distances several times smaller than those predicted by Kasha's theory. Moreover, since the total coupling drives exciton transport and photophysical properties, interference between the short- and long-range (Coulomb) couplings, as manifest by their relative signs and magnitudes, gives rise to a host of new aggregate types, referred to as HH, HJ, JH, and JJ aggregates, with distinct photophysical properties. An extreme example is the ``null'' HJ-aggregate in which total destructive interference leads to absorption line shapes practically identical to uncoupled molecules. Moreover, the severely compromised exciton bandwidth effectively shuts down energy transport. Most importantly, the new aggregates types described herein can be exploited for electronic materials design. For example, the enhanced exciton bandwidth and weakly emissive properties of HH-aggregates make them ideal candidates for solar cell absorbers, while the enhanced charge mobility and strong emissive behavior of JJ-aggregates makes them excellent candidates for light-emitting diodes.},

As a consequence, constraints such as the principle of equal a priori probabilities in the microcanonical ensemble can be relaxed, which can lead to quantum states with novel properties of genuine nonequilibrium nature. In turn, for the theoretical description it is in general not sufficient to understand nonequilibrium dynamics on the basis of the properties of the involved Hamiltonians. Instead it becomes important to characterize time-evolution operators, which adds time as an additional scale to the problem. In this perspective article we summarize recent progress in the field of dynamical quantum phase transitions, which are phase transitions in time with temporal nonanalyticities in matrix elements of the time-evolution operator. These transitions are not driven by an external control parameter, but rather occur due to sharp internal changes generated solely by unitary real-time dynamics. We discuss the obtained insights on general properties of dynamical quantum phase transitions, their physical interpretation, potential future research directions, as well as recent experimental observations.},

The goal is to provide the reader with (1) an appreciation for what QDs are capable of in this context, (2) how this field has grown over a relatively short time span, and, in particular, (3) how QDs are steadily revolutionizing the development of new biosensors along with a myriad of other photonically active nanomaterial-based bioconjugates. An initial discussion of QD materials along with key concepts surrounding their preparation and bioconjugation is provided given the defining role these aspects play in the QDs ability to succeed in subsequent ET applications. The discussion is then divided around the specific roles that QDs provide as either F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) or charge/electron transfer donor and/or acceptor. For each QD-ET mechanism, a working explanation of the appropriate background theory and formalism is articulated before examining their biosensing and related ET utility. Other configurations such as incorporation of QDs into multistep ET processes or use of initial chemical and bioluminescent excitation are treated similarly. ET processes that are still not fully understood such as QD interactions with gold and other metal nanoparticles along with carbon allotropes are also covered. Given their maturity, some specific applications ranging from in vitro sensing assays to cellular imaging are separated and discussed in more detail.

  abstract = {The matrix product state formulation of the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree theory, MPS-MCTDH, reported previously [Kurashige, J. Chem. Phys. 2018, 19, 194114] is extended to realistic anharmonic potentials with n-mode representations beyond the linear vibronic coupling model. For realistic vibrational potentials, the local mode representation should give a more compact representation of the potentials, i.e., lowering the dimensionality of the entanglements, than the normal coordinates, and the MPS-MCTDH formulation should work more efficiently and maintain the accuracy with a small bond dimension of the MPS ansatz. In fact, it was confirmed that the use of the local coordinates made the interaction matrices diagonal dominant and the number of terms in the n-body expansion of the potentials was significantly reduced. The method was applied to the IR spectrum of the CH2O molecule, the zero-point energies, and the vibrational energy redistribution dynamics of polyenes C2nH2n+2. The results showed that the efficiency of the MPS-MCTDH method is significantly accelerated by the use of local coordinates even if the long-range interactions are included in the potential.},

We find that the spinon heat conductivity {$\kappa$}mag is strongly enhanced as compared to previous results obtained on samples with lower chemical purity. The analysis of {$\kappa$}mag allows the computation of the spinon mean free path lmag as a function of temperature. At low temperature we find lmag {$\sim$} 0.5 {\textmu}m, corresponding to more than 1200 chain unit cells. Upon increasing the temperature, the mean free path decreases strongly and approaches an exponential decay {$\sim$} (1/T)exp(Tu*/T), which is characteristic for Umklapp processes with the energy scale kBTu*. Based on Matthiessen's rule we decompose lmag into a temperature-independent spinon--defect scattering length l0 and a temperature-dependent spinon--phonon scattering length lsp(T). By comparing lmag(T) of Sr2CuO3 with that of SrCuO2, we show that the spin--phonon interaction, as expressed by lsp, is practically the same in both systems. The comparison of the empirically derived lsp with model calculations for the spin--phonon interaction of the one-dimensional spin-1/2 XY model yields reasonable agreement with the experimental data.},

By combining the variational polaron transformed master equation with the full counting statistics, we extended the applicability of the polaron-based framework to study nonequilibrium process beyond the super-Ohmic bath models. Previously, the polaron-based framework for quantum heat transport reduces exactly to the non-interacting blip approximation (NIBA) formalism for Ohmic bath models due to the issue of the infrared divergence associated with the full polaron transformation. The nonequilibrium variational method allows us to appropriately treat the infrared divergence in the low-frequency bath modes and explicitly include cross-bath correlation effects. These improvements provide more accurate calculation of heat current than the NIBA formalism for Ohmic bath models. We illustrate the aforementioned improvements with the nonequilibrium spin-boson model in this work and quantitatively demonstrate the cross-bath correlation, current turnover, and rectification effects in quantum heat transfer.},

Phys. 148, 014103 (2018)] to study decoherence in a system coupled to a spin bath. The present methodology allows a systematic incorporation of higher-order anharmonic effects of the bath in dynamical calculations. We investigate the leading order corrections to the linear response approximations for spin bath models. Two kinds of spin-based environments are considered: (1) a bath of spins discretized from a continuous spectral density and (2) a bath of localized nuclear or electron spins. The main difference resides with how the bath frequency and the system-bath coupling parameters are distributed in an environment. When discretized from a continuous spectral density, the system-bath coupling typically scales as {$\sim$}1/NB where NB is the number of bath spins. This scaling suppresses the non-Gaussian characteristics of the spin bath and justifies the linear response approximations in the thermodynamic limit. For the nuclear/electron spin bath models, system-bath couplings are directly deduced from spin-spin interactions and do not necessarily obey the 1/NB scaling. It is not always possible to justify the linear response approximations in this case. Furthermore, if the spin-spin Hamiltonian is highly symmetrical, there exist additional constraints that generate highly non-Markovian and persistent dynamics that is beyond the linear response treatments.},

We exemplify the general framework by studying a two-level quantum system coupled bilinearly to the three fundamental classes of non-interacting particles: bosons, fermions, and spins. In this unified stochastic approach, the generalized stochastic Liouville equation (SLE) formally captures the exact quantum dissipations when noise variables with appropriate statistics for different bath models are applied. Anharmonic effects of a non-Gaussian bath are precisely encoded in the bath multi-time correlation functions that noise variables have to satisfy. Starting from the SLE, we devise a family of generalized hierarchical equations by averaging out the noise variables and expand bath multi-time correlation functions in a complete basis of orthonormal functions. The general hierarchical equations constitute systems of linear equations that provide numerically exact simulations of quantum dynamics. For bosonic bath models, our general hierarchical equation of motion reduces exactly to an extended version of hierarchical equation of motion which allows efficient simulation for arbitrary spectral densities and temperature regimes. Similar efficiency and flexibility can be achieved for the fermionic bath models within our formalism. The spin bath models can be simulated with two complementary approaches in the present formalism. (I) They can be viewed as an example of non-Gaussian bath models and be directly handled with the general hierarchical equation approach given their multi-time correlation functions. (II) Alternatively, each bath spin can be first mapped onto a pair of fermions and be treated as fermionic environments within the present formalism.},

Mutation-induced perturbation to the exciton structure and the optical spectra of the complex provide a suitable means to investigate the critical role played by the protein scaffold. In this work, we have performed quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics calculations over the molecular dynamics simulation trajectories with the polarized protein-specific charge scheme for both wild-type FMOs and two mutants. Our result reveals that a single-point mutation in the vicinity of BChl 6, namely, W183F of C. tepidum, significantly affects the absorption spectrum, resulting in a switch of the absorption spectrum from type 2, for which the 806 nm band is more pronounced than the 815 nm band, to type 1, for which the 815 nm band is pronounced. Our observations agree with the single-point mutation experiments reported by Saer et al. (Biochim. Biophys. Acta, Bioenerg. 2017, 1858, 288--296) and Khmelnitskiy et al. (J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2018, 9, 3378--3386). In contrast, the absorption spectrum of the P. aestuarii experiences the opposite transition (from type 1 to type 2) upon the same mutation. Furthermore, by comparing the contributions of individual pigments to the spectra in the wild type and its mutant, we find that a single-point mutation near BChl 6 not only induces changes in excitation energy of BChl 6 per se but also affects the excitonic structures of the neighboring BChls 5 and 7 through strong interpigment electronic couplings, resulting in a significant change in the absorption spectra.},

  abstract = {The purpose of analytic continuation is to establish a real frequency spectral representation of single-particle or two-particle correlation function (such as Green's function, self-energy function, spin and charge susceptibilities) from noisy data generated in finite temperature quantum Monte Carlo simulations. It requires numerical solutions of a family of Fredholm integral equations of the first kind, which is indeed a challenging task. In this paper, an open source toolkit (dubbed ACFlow) for analytic continuation of quantum Monte Carlo data is presented. We first give a short introduction to the analytic continuation problem. Next, three popular analytic continuation algorithms, including the maximum entropy method, the stochastic analytic continuation, and the stochastic optimization method, as implemented in this toolkit are reviewed. And then we elaborate on the major features, implementation details, basic usage, inputs, and outputs of this toolkit. Finally, four representative examples, including analytic continuations of Matsubara self-energy function, Matsubara and imaginary time Green's functions, and current-current correlation function, are shown to demonstrate the usefulness and flexibility of the ACFlow toolkit.

In order to extract physical observables and compare them with the experimental results, analytic continuation must be done in the post-processing stage to convert the quantum Monte Carlo simulated data from imaginary axis to real axis. Solution method: Three well-established analytic continuation methods, including the maximum entropy method, the stochastic analytic continuation (both A. W. Sandvik's and K. S. D. Beach's algorithms), and the stochastic optimization method, have been implemented in the ACFlow toolkit. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: The ACFlow toolkit is written in pure Julia language. It is highly optimized and parallelized. It can be executed interactively in a Jupyter notebook environment.},

Phys. 93, 1061 (1990)]---along with its many later variations---forms the basis for most practical simulations of molecular dynamics with electronic transitions in realistic systems. Despite its popularity, a rigorous formal derivation of the algorithm has yet to be achieved. In this paper, we derive the energy-conserving momentum jumps employed by FSSH from the perspective of quantum trajectory surface hopping (QTSH) [Martens, J. Phys. Chem. A 123, 1110 (2019)]. In the limit of localized nonadiabatic transitions, simple mathematical and physical arguments allow the FSSH algorithm to be derived from first principles. For general processes, the quantum forces characterizing the QTSH method provide accurate results for nonadiabatic dynamics with rigorous energy conservation, at the ensemble level, within the consistency of the underlying stochastic surface hopping without resorting to the artificial momentum rescaling of FSSH.},

A more mathematical understanding was needed. To close this gap we show in this paper the equivalence of the new method with a first order expansion of ℏ of the Schr{\"o}dinger equation. We further prove that the new method is equivalent to the stationary phase approximation, using the usual WKB formula for the propagator. The latter equivalence enables us to show that all the symmetry properties of time-dependent quantum mechanics also hold in the new semiclassical theory. Finally, we provide some elaboration of the method, and clarify several issues that were not discussed before. With this new insight we are able to formulate a simple rule for the calculation of semiclassical wave functions that contain contributions from more than one branch. This corrects for the divergence of semiclassical wave functions near caustics, a problem that we encountered in the preceding paper.},

  abstract = {Finite-temperature many-body perturbation theory in the grand-canonical ensemble is fundamental to numerous methods for computing electronic properties at nonzero temperature, such as finite-temperature coupled-cluster. In most applications it is the average number of electrons that is known rather than the chemical potential. Expensive correlation calculations must be repeated iteratively in search for the interacting chemical potential that yields the desired average number of electrons. In extended systems with mobile charges the situation is particular, however. Long-ranged electrostatic forces drive the charges such that the average ratio of negative and positive charges is one for any finite chemical potential. All properties per electron are expected to be virtually independent of the chemical potential, as they are in an electric wire at different voltage potentials. This work shows that per electron, the exchange-correlation free energy and the exchange-correlation grand potential indeed agree in the infinite-size limit. Thus, only one expensive correlation calculation suffices for each system size, sparing the search for the interacting chemical potential. This work also demonstrates the importance of regularizing the Coulomb interaction such that each electron on average interacts only with as many electrons as there are electrons in the simulation, avoiding interactions with periodic images. Numerical calculations of the warm uniform electron gas have been conducted with the Spencer--Alavi regularization employing the finite-temperature Hartree approximation for the self-consistent field and linearized finite-temperature direct-ring coupled-cluster doubles for treating correlation.},

We apply two different models, the Hamiltonian vibration model (HVM) and bath vibration model (BVM), to a monomer and a homodimer. In the HVM, we specifically include the vibronic states in the Hamiltonian capturing vibronic quenching, whereas in the BVM, all vibrational details are contained within the bath and described by an underdamped spectral density. The resultant spectra are analyzed in terms of energetic peak position and thermodynamic broadening precision in order to evaluate the efficacy of the two models. The HVM produces 2D spectra with accurate peak positional information, while the BVM is well suited to modeling dynamic peak broadening. For the monomer, both models produce equivalent spectra in the limit where additional damping associated with the underdamped vibration in the BVM approaches zero. This is supported by analytical results. However, for the homodimer, the BVM spectra are redshifted with respect to the HVM due to an absence of vibronic quenching in the BVM. The computational efficiency of the two models is also discussed in order to inform us of the most appropriate use of each method.},

The degree of non-Markovianity for a trajectory may be measured in terms of the amount of information flowing from the bath back into the system. In this study, we consider how information flows through the auxiliary density operators (ADOs) in the hierarchical equations of motion. We consider three cases for a range of baths, underdamped, intermediate, and overdamped. By understanding how information flows, we are able to determine the relative importance of different ADOs within the hierarchy. We show that ADOs sharing a common Matsubara axis behave similarly, while ADOs on different Matsubara axes behave differently. Using this knowledge, we are able to truncate hierarchies significantly, thus reducing the computation time, while obtaining qualitatively similar results. This is illustrated by comparing 2D electronic spectra for a molecule with an underdamped vibration subsumed into the bath spectral density.},

We apply the CMRT method to simulate the EET in a dimer system and compare the results with those obtained from numerically exact path integral calculations. The comparison shows that CMRT provides excellent computational efficiency and accuracy within a large EET parameter space. Furthermore, we simulate the EET dynamics in the FMO complex at 77K using CMRT. The results show pronounced non-Markovian effects and long-lasting coherences in the ultrafast EET, in excellent agreement with calculations using the hierarchy equation of motion approach. In summary, we have successfully developed a simple yet powerful framework for coherent EET dynamics in photosynthetic systems and organic materials.},

New TBFs are spawned when nuclear wavepackets enter regions of strong nonadiabaticity, permitting the description of non-Born--Oppenheimer processes. The spawning algorithm is simultaneously the blessing and the curse of the AIMS method: it allows for an accurate description of the transfer of nuclear amplitude between different electronic states, but it also dramatically increases the computational cost of the AIMS dynamics as all TBFs are coupled. Recently, a strategy coined stochastic-selection AIMS (SSAIMS) was devised to limit the ever-growing number of TBFs and tested on simple molecules. In this work, we use the photodynamics of three different molecules---cyclopropanone, fulvene, and 1,2-dithiane---to investigate (i) the potential of SSAIMS to reproduce reference AIMS results for challenging nonadiabatic dynamics, (ii) the compromise achieved by SSAIMS in obtaining accurate results while using the smallest average number of TBFs as possible, and (iii) the performance of SSAIMS in comparison to the mixed quantum/classical method trajectory surface hopping (TSH)---both in terms of its accuracy and computational cost. We show that SSAIMS can accurately reproduce the AIMS results for the three molecules considered at a much cheaper computational cost, often close to that of TSH. We deduce from these tests that an overlap-based criterion for the stochastic-selection process leads to the best agreement with the reference AIMS dynamics for the smallest average number of TBFs.},

  abstract = {Simulating electron--nucleus coupled dynamics poses a nontrivial challenge and an important problem in the investigation of ultrafast processes involving coupled electronic and vibrational dynamics. Because irreversibility of the system dynamics results from thermal activation and dissipation caused by the environment, in dynamical studies, it is necessary to include heat bath degrees of freedom in the total system. When the system dynamics involves high-energy electronic transitions, the environment is regarded to be in a low-temperature regime and we must treat it quantum mechanically. In this Article, we present rigorous and versatile approaches for investigating the dynamics of open systems with coupled electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom within a fully quantum mechanical framework. These approaches are based on a quantum Fokker--Planck equation and a quantum Smoluchowski equation employing a heat bath with an Ohmic spectral density, with non-Markovian low-temperature correction terms, and extensions of these equations to the case of multistate systems. The accuracy of these equations was numerically examined for a single-state Brownian system, while their applicability was examined for multistate double-well systems by comparing their results with those of the fewest-switch surface hopping and Ehrenfest methods with a classical Markovian Langevin force. Comparison of the transient absorption spectra obtained using these methods clearly reveals the importance of the quantum low-temperature correction terms. These equations allow us to treat nonadiabatic dynamics in an efficient way, while maintaining numerical accuracy. The C++ source codes that we developed, which allow for the treatment of the phase and coordinate space dynamics with any single-state or multistate potential forms, are provided as Supporting Information.},

The central concept concerns the so-called quasilocal conserved quantities, which go beyond the standard perception of locality. Two systematic procedures to rigorously construct families of quasilocal conserved operators based on quantum transfer matrices are outlined, specializing on anisotropic Heisenberg XXZ spin-1/2 chain. Quasilocal conserved operators stem from two distinct classes of representations of the auxiliary space algebra, comprised of unitary (compact) representations, which can be naturally linked to the fusion algebra and quasiparticle content of the model, and non-unitary (non-compact) representations giving rise to charges, manifestly orthogonal to the unitary ones. Various condensed matter applications in which quasilocal conservation laws play an essential role are presented, with special emphasis on their implications for anomalous transport properties (finite Drude weight) and relaxation to non-thermal steady states in the quantum quench scenario.},

  abstract = {Metal--organic frameworks (MOFs) have a wide range of optoelectronic and photochemical applications, many of which are directly dependent on their excited states. Computational modelling of excited state processes could aid the rational design of effective catalysts, but simulating MOFs in their excited state is challenging. This is due to the inherent molecule/crystal duality of MOFs, their large and diverse unit cells, and the unfavourable scalability of quantum chemical methods. However, periodic and cluster models have been developed and applied to characterise the excited states of MOFs and their properties, such as charge transfer, luminescence, and photocatalytic mechanisms. Additionally, embedding techniques provide a means of explicitly incorporating the crystal environment in such models. Although many high-quality reviews have assessed computational modelling in MOFs, most have focused on the study of ground-state electronic properties. In this perspective, we focus on the computational methods available to describe the excited states of MOFs from the molecular, periodic, and embedding perspectives. To illustrate the performance of cluster and periodic models, we compare the results obtained using both approaches at different levels of theory for an exemplary MOF. We also analyse examples from modelling relevant photochemical and photophysical including charge transfer, exciton effects, chemosensing, host--guest mechanisms, thermally activated delayed fluorescence and room temperature phosphorescence. Additionally, we show how such methods can be applied to predict MOF-based photocatalytic CO2 reduction to value-added chemicals. We emphasise the advantages and limitations of current methodologies, as well as the potential for utilising databases and machine learning models in this context.},

(2007) Evidence for wavelike energy transfer through quantum coherence in photosynthetic systems. Nature 446:782--786]. In this paper, the spatial and temporal dynamics of EET through the FMO complex at physiological temperature are investigated theoretically. The numerical results reveal that quantum wave-like motion persists for several hundred femtoseconds even at physiological temperature, and suggest that the FMO complex may work as a rectifier for unidirectional energy flow from the peripheral light-harvesting antenna to the reaction center complex by taking advantage of quantum coherence and the energy landscape of pigments tuned by the protein scaffold. A potential role of quantum coherence is to overcome local energetic traps and aid efficient trapping of electronic energy by the pigments facing the reaction center complex.},

Despite their significance, formal connections between the two have not been explicitly known. We establish their connections by examining the system propagator for a N-level system linearly coupled to Gaussian baths with various types of system-bath coupling. For a certain class of problems, we devised a non-perturbative, diagrammatic approach to construct \$\$\{\{\{{\textbackslash}bf\{\{\{\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{K\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\$\$from I for (driven) systems interacting with Gaussian baths, bypassing conventional projection-free dynamics inputs. Our work provides a way to interpret approximate path integral methods in terms of approximate memory kernels. Moreover, it offers a Hamiltonian learning procedure to extract the bath spectral density from reduced system trajectories, opening new avenues in quantum sensing and engineering. The insights we provide advance our understanding of non-Markovian dynamics and will serve as a stepping stone for future theoretical and experimental developments in this area.},

Izadi et al., J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 5, 3863 (2014)], which permits a virtually exhaustive search for globally optimal model parameters in the sub-space that is most relevant to the electrostatic properties of the water molecule in liquid phase. Here we apply the approach to develop a 3-point Optimal Point Charge (OPC3) water model. OPC3 is significantly more accurate than the commonly used water models of same class (TIP3P and SPCE) in reproducing a comprehensive set of liquid bulk properties, over a wide range of temperatures. Beyond bulk properties, we show that OPC3 predicts the intrinsic charge hydration asymmetry (CHA) of water --- a characteristic dependence of hydration free energy on the sign of the solute charge --- in very close agreement with experiment. Two other recent 3-point rigid water models, TIP3PFB and H2ODC, each developed by its own, completely different optimization method, approach the global accuracy optimum represented by OPC3 in both the parameter space and accuracy of bulk properties. Thus, we argue that an accuracy limit of practical 3-point rigid non-polarizable models has effectively been reached; remaining accuracy issues are discussed.},

In the present work, we attempt to enhance the efficiency of the method by minimizing numerical errors in the COS procedure. The main idea is based on the work of Friesner and consists of finding a fitting matrix, {\textbackslash}documentclass[12pt]\{minimal\}{\textbackslash}begin\{document\}\${\textbackslash}mathbf \{Q\}\${\textbackslash}end\{document\}Q, which leads the numerical and analytically evaluated overlap matrices to coincide. Using {\textbackslash}documentclass[12pt]\{minimal\}{\textbackslash}begin\{document\}\${\textbackslash}mathbf \{Q\}\${\textbackslash}end\{document\}Q, the evaluation of exchange integrals can indeed be improved. Improved results and timings are obtained with the present default grid setup for both single point calculations and geometry optimizations. The fitting procedure results in a reduction of grid sizes necessary for achieving chemical accuracy. We demonstrate this by testing a number of grids and comparing results to the fully analytic and the earlier COS approximations. This turns out to be favourable for total and reaction energies, for which chemical accuracy can now be reached with a corresponding {$\sim$}30\% speedup over the original RIJCOSX procedure for single point energies. Results are slightly less favourable for the accuracy of geometry optimizations, but the procedure is still shown to yield geometries with errors well below the method inherent errors of the employed theoretical framework.},

If the proposed procedure is also combined with RIJCOSX in SCF, then a somewhat larger error occurs, but reaction energy errors will still remain negligible. The speedup for the singles Fock term only is about 9?10 fold for the largest basis set applied. For the case of Penicillin using the def2-QZVPP basis set, a single point energy evaluation takes 2 day 16?h on a single processor leading to a total speedup of 2.6 as compared to a fully analytic calculation.

It will be shown that due to the conceptual similarity between complementary auxiliary basis functions of explicitly correlated approaches and the dealiasing functions of pseudospectral methods, the former can be used in a similar manner as the latter to cancel numerical errors. In contrast to the dealiasing functions, the complementary auxiliary basis functions are not specific to the integration grid.

Consequently, the TD-DFT excess dipole moments are often too small, an error that can be fortuitously corrected for charge-transfer transition by selecting a pure or a hybrid functional containing a small share of exact exchange. This error-cancelation phenomena explains the contradictory conclusions obtained in previous investigations. Overall, the largest correlation between CC2 and TD-DFT excess dipoles is obtained with M06-2X, but at the price of a nearly systematic underestimation of this property by ca. 1 D. For the excess quadrupole moments, the average errors are of the order of 0.2--0.6 D{$\cdot\Angstroem$} for the set of small aromatic systems treated.},

In a molecular context, this situation can arise if the symmetry is broken by isotopic substitutions. We derive a generalization of instanton theory for these asymmetric systems, leading to a semiclassical expression for the tunneling matrix element and hence the energy-level splitting. We benchmark the method using a set of one- and two-dimensional models, for which the results compare favorably with numerically exact quantum calculations. Using the ring-polymer instanton approach, we apply the method to compute the level splittings in various isotopomers of malonaldehyde in full dimensionality and analyze the relative contributions from the zero-point energy difference and tunneling effects.},

To gain this efficiency, we assume the system is in the inhomogeneous regime and that there is no significant nonadiabatic transfer of population during the t1 and t3 coherence times. Preliminary results are presented for the Frenkel Hamiltonian. We obtain excellent agreement with numerically exact results (which are possible for this simplistic model Hamiltonian), capturing all relevant trends at least qualitatively (and sometimes quantitatively).},

Nevertheless, the corresponding results for the electron mobility {$\mu$}dc are scarce, even for the one-dimensional (1d) Holstein model. Building on our recent progress on single-particle properties, here we develop the momentum-space hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method to evaluate real-time two-particle correlation functions of the 1d Holstein model at a finite temperature. We compute numerically ``exact'' dynamics of the current--current correlation function up to real times sufficiently long to capture the electron's diffusive motion and provide reliable results for {$\mu$}dc in a wide range of model parameters. In contrast to the smooth ballistic-to-diffusive crossover in the weak-coupling regime, we observe a temporally limited slow-down of the electron on intermediate time scales already in the intermediate-coupling regime, which translates to a finite-frequency peak in the optical response. Our momentum-space formulation lowers the numerical effort with respect to existing HEOM-method implementations, while we remove the numerical instabilities inherent to the undamped-mode HEOM by devising an appropriate hierarchy closing scheme. Still, our HEOM remains unstable at too low temperatures, for too strong electron--phonon coupling, and for too fast phonons.},

One is based on the popular surface-hopping method, and the other is based on rescaling of the propagation on the bath ground-state potential surface. The first method is special, as it avoids specific feedback from the simulated quantum system to the bath and can be applied for precalculated classical trajectories. It is based on the equipartition theorem to determine if hops between different potential energy surfaces are allowed. By comparing with the formally exact Hierarchical Equations Of Motion approach for four model systems we find that the method generally approximates the quantum dynamics toward thermal equilibrium very well. The second method is based on rescaling of the nonadiabatic coupling and also neglect the effect of the state of the quantum system on the bath. By the nature of the approximations, they cannot reproduce the effect of bath relaxation following excitation. However, the methods are both computationally more tractable than the conventional fewest switches surface hopping, and we foresee that the methods will be powerful for simulations of quantum dynamics in systems with complex bath dynamics, where the system--bath coupling is not too strong compared to the thermal energy.},

We first analyse the effect of confinement on the Gaussification of the PDF for large               {$\ell$}               , showing that the melting of initial order is suppressed when the longitudinal field is aligned to initial magnetisation while it is speed up when it is in the opposite direction. Then we study the thermalisation dynamics. In the paramagnetic region, the PDF quickly shows thermal features. Conversely, in the ferromagnetic phase, when confinement takes place, the relaxation suffers a typical slowing down which depends on the interplay between the strength of the longitudinal field, the density of excitations, and the direction of the initial polarisation. Even when the initial magnetisation is aligned oppositely to the longitudinal field, confinement prevents thermalisation in the accessible timescale, as it is neatly bared by the PDF.},

Manipulating this reactivity in a controlled way is difficult because the hypothesized metal-alkane charge-transfer interactions are challenging to access experimentally. Using time-resolved x-ray spectroscopy, we track the charge-transfer interactions during C?H activation of octane by a cyclopentadienyl rhodium carbonyl complex. Changes in oxidation state as well as valence-orbital energies and character emerge in the data on a femtosecond to nanosecond timescale. The x-ray spectroscopic signatures reflect how alkane-to-metal donation determines metal-alkane complex stability and how metal-to-alkane back-donation facilitates C?H bond cleavage by oxidative addition. The ability to dissect charge-transfer interactions on an orbital level provides opportunities for manipulating C?H reactivity at transition metals. The capacity of metals such as rhodium and palladium to cleave carbon?hydrogen bonds facilitates numerous useful chemical reactions. Fundamental studies of the underlying dynamics at the metal center have often relied indirectly on shifts in the vibrational frequency of a spectator carbon monoxide ligand as the reaction with hydrocarbons ensues. Jay et al. used x-ray spectroscopy to study the ultrafast evolution of rhodium?s electronic state directly as the metal bound and then broke a carbon?hydrogen bond in octane. ?Jake Yeston Ultrafast x-ray spectroscopy reveals the electronic state changes as rhodium binds and then cleaves a carbon?hydrogen bond in octane.},

  abstract = {The Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) light-harvesting complex is now one of the primary model systems for the study of excitation energy transfer (EET). However, the mechanism of the EET in this system is still controversial. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations and the electrostatic-embedding quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics single-point calculations have been employed to predict the energy transfer pathways utilizing the polarized protein-specific charge (PPC), which provides a more realistic description of Coulomb interaction potential in the protein than conventional mean-field charge scheme. The recently discovered eighth pigment has also been included in this study. Comparing with the conventional mean-field charges, more stable structures of FMO complex were found under PPC scheme during molecular dynamic simulation. Based on the electronic structure calculations, an exciton model was constructed to consider the couplings during excitation. The results show that pigments 3 and 4 dominate the lowest exciton levels whereas the highest exciton level are mainly constituted of pigments 1 and 6. This observation agrees well with the assumption based on the spatial distribution of the pigments. Moreover, the obtained spectral density in this study gives a reliable description of the diverse local environment embedding each pigment.},

  abstract = {Large-scale computational molecular models provide scientists a means to investigate the effect of microscopic details on emergent mesoscopic behavior. Elucidating the relationship between variations on the molecular scale and macroscopic observable properties facilitates an understanding of the molecular interactions driving the properties of real world materials and complex systems (e.g., those found in biology, chemistry, and materials science). As a result, discovering an explicit, systematic connection between microscopic nature and emergent mesoscopic behavior is a fundamental goal for this type of investigation. The molecular forces critical to driving the behavior of complex heterogeneous systems are often unclear. More problematically, simulations of representative model systems are often prohibitively expensive from both spatial and temporal perspectives, impeding straightforward investigations over possible hypotheses characterizing molecular behavior. While the reduction in resolution of a study, such as moving from an atomistic simulation to that of the resolution of large coarse-grained (CG) groups of atoms, can partially ameliorate the cost of individual simulations, the relationship between the proposed microscopic details and this intermediate resolution is nontrivial and presents new obstacles to study. Small portions of these complex systems can be realistically simulated. Alone, these smaller simulations likely do not provide insight into collectively emergent behavior. However, by proposing that the driving forces in both smaller and larger systems (containing many related copies of the smaller system) have an explicit connection, systematic bottom-up CG techniques can be used to transfer CG hypotheses discovered using a smaller scale system to a larger system of primary interest. The proposed connection between different CG systems is prescribed by (i) the CG representation (mapping) and (ii) the functional form and parameters used to represent the CG energetics, which approximate potentials of mean force (PMFs). As a result, the design of CG methods that facilitate a variety of physically relevant representations, approximations, and force fields is critical to moving the frontier of systematic CG forward. Crucially, the proposed connection between the system used for parametrization and the system of interest is orthogonal to the optimization used to approximate the potential of mean force present in all systematic CG methods. The empirical efficacy of machine learning techniques on a variety of tasks provides strong motivation to consider these approaches for approximating the PMF and analyzing these approximations.},

The theoretical construction starts with the influence functional in path integral, in which the electron creation and annihilation operators are Grassmann variables. Time derivatives on the influence functionals are then performed in a hierarchical manner. Both the multiple-frequency dispersion and the non-Markovian reservoir parametrization schemes are considered for the desired hierarchy construction. The resulting hierarchical equations of motion formalism is in principle exact and applicable to arbitrary electronic systems, including Coulomb interactions, under the influence of arbitrary time-dependent applied bias voltage and external fields. Both the conventional quantum master equation and the real-time diagrammatic formalism of Sch{\"o}n and co-workers can be readily obtained at well defined limits of the present theory. We also show that for a noninteracting electron system, the present hierarchical equations of motion formalism terminates at the second tier exactly, and the Landuer--B{\"u}ttiker transport current expression is recovered. The present theory renders an exact and numerically tractable tool to evaluate various transient and stationary quantum transport properties of many-electron systems, together with the involving nonperturbative dissipative dynamics.},

  abstract = {Controlled directional light propagation using optical nonlinearity has previously been proposed. Here, we propose a one-way optical device with linear elements controlled by synthetic magnetic fluxes. The device consists of two parity--time symmetric side-coupled resonators with balanced gain and loss. The gain and loss break the reflection symmetry and the magnetic fluxes break the transmission symmetry. Through tuning the magnetic fluxes, reflectionless full transmission in one direction and transmissionless full reflection in the opposite direction can be achieved. The device acts as a light-checking valve, preventing wave propagation in one direction. The proposed one-way transporter uses the nonreciprocity induced by non-Hermiticity and magnetic fluxes without applying nonlinearity. We anticipate that our findings will be useful for optical control and manipulation. Introduction and background. Light propagation is reciprocal in a linear system. The reciprocity of light is protected by time-reversal symmetry. For many years, directional light propagation has been a goal of research. A previous proposal used a series of nonlinear elements in which nonlinearity breaks the time-reversal symmetry and thus the reciprocity of light (Lepri S and Casati G 2011 Phys. Rev. Lett. 106 164101). Main results. We propose a new method for realizing one-way light transport in a linear system. The non-Hermiticity and synthetic magnetic fluxes in the system break the light reciprocity. The system is an AB interferometer with a pair of side-coupled PT-symmetric resonators. We demonstrated that with the appropriate application of the magnetic fluxes, gain and loss, transmissionless fully reflected light incidence in one direction and reflectionless fully transmitted light incidence in the opposite direction can be realized (figure 1). Instead of using nonlinearity, the proposed method utilizes the emission and absorption of the gain and loss resonators to realize the unity amplitude for unidirectional propagation after scattering. The magnetic fluxes assist in achieving asymmetric transmission and destructive interference. Wider implications. The proposal provides an effective method for one-way light transport without the application of nonlinearity. The findings provide an insight into the interplay between non-Hermiticity and magnetic fluxes. We anticipate that our results will be useful for the application of PT metamaterials. Figure.

  abstract = {Determining the Fourier representation of various molecular interactions is important for constructing density-based field theories from a microscopic point of view, enabling a multiscale bridge between microscopic and mesoscopic descriptions. However, due to the strongly repulsive nature of short-ranged interactions, interparticle interactions cannot be formally defined in Fourier space, which renders coarse-grained (CG) approaches in k-space somewhat ambiguous. In this paper, we address this issue by designing a perturbative expansion of pair interactions in reciprocal space. Our perturbation theory, starting from reciprocal space, elucidates the microscopic origins underlying zeroth-order (long-range attractions) and divergent repulsive interactions from higher order contributions. We propose a systematic framework for constructing a faithful Fourier-space representation of molecular interactions, capturing key structural correlations in various systems, including simple model systems and molecular CG models of liquids. Building upon the Ornstein--Zernike equation, our approach can be combined with appropriate closure relations, and to further improve the closure approximations, we develop a bottom-up parameterization strategy for inferring the bridge function from microscopic statistics. By incorporating the bridge function into the Fourier representation, our findings suggest a systematic, bottom-up approach to performing coarse-graining in reciprocal space, leading to the systematic construction of a bottom-up classical field theory of complex aqueous systems.},

The results are further elucidated by studying the scattering of rhombic ring form coupled resonators with enclosed synthetic magnetic flux. The nonreciprocal phase shift induced by the magnetic flux and gain/loss break the parity and time-reversal symmetry but keep the parity-time symmetry. The reciprocal reflection (transmission) and unidirectional transmission (reflection) are found in the axial (reflection) -symmetric ring centre. The explorations of symmetry and asymmetry from symmetry may shed light on novel one-way optical devices and application of -symmetric metamaterials.},

  abstract = {The techniques of computational photodynamics are increasingly employed to unravel reaction mechanisms and interpret experiments. However, misinterpretations in nonadiabatic dynamics caused by inaccurate underlying potentials are often difficult to foresee. This work focuses on revealing the systematic errors in the nonadiabatic simulations due to the underlying potentials and suggests a thrifty approach to evaluate the sensitivity of the simulations to the potential. This issue is exemplified in the photochemistry of cis-stilbene, where similar experimental outcomes have been differently interpreted based on the electronic structure methods supporting nonadiabatic dynamics. We examine the predictions of cis-stilbene photochemistry using trajectory surface hopping methods coupled with various electronic structure methods (OM3-MRCISD, SA2-CASSCF, XMS-SA2-CASPT2, and XMS-SA3-CASPT2) and assess their ability to interpret experimental observations. While the excited-state lifetimes and calculated photoelectron spectra show consistency with experiments, the reaction quantum yields vary significantly: either completely suppressing cyclization or isomerization. Intriguingly, analyzing stationary points on the potential energy surface does not hint at any major discrepancy, making the electronic structure methods seemingly reliable when treated separately. We show that performing an ensemble of simulations with different potentials provides an estimate of the electronic structure sensitivity. However, this ensemble approach is costly. Thus, we propose running nonadiabatic simulations with an external bias at a resource-efficient underlying potential (semiempirical or machine-learned) for the sensitivity analysis. We demonstrate this approach using a semiempirical OM3-MRCISD method with a harmonic bias toward cyclization.},

  abstract = {Certain organic materials can generate more than one electron-hole pair per absorbed photon, a property that could revolutionize the prospects for solar energy. This process, called singlet fission, is one possible ``exciton multiplication'' scheme that could be useful in a variety of photovoltaic device designs from dye-sensitized solar cells to solar cell bilayers to bulk heterojunctions. For such applications to be possible, however, singlet fission must occur with near perfect efficiency in compounds that also have other requisite properties such as strong visible light absorption and photostability. Many recent investigations of singlet fission have focused on crystalline polyacenes, which have been known for some time to undergo singlet fission. While these materials have promise, limitations in stability, cost, and performance may hinder practical application of polyacene solar cells, while their complex photophysics may limit our fundamental understanding of singlet fission in crystalline polyacenes.In this Account, we describe rationally designed singlet fission chromophores whose excited state dynamics should be fairly simple and whose coupling can be well controlled through the formation of covalent dimers, aggregates, or polycrystalline films. In principle, investigations of these chromophores should provide the clearest connection to theoretical concepts explaining how an excited state evolves from a singlet (S1) into two triplets (TT). Realizing the promise of efficient singlet fission rests with two tasks: (i) producing an ideal molecular energy level structure and (ii) inducing the correct type and strength of chromophore coupling. In this Account, we offer theoretical guidance for achieving (i) and consider more extensively recent results aimed at (ii).For (i), theoretical guidance suggests that, in addition to alternant hydrocarbons like tetracene and pentacene, biradicals (i.e., molecules with two independent radical centers) may also be used as the basis for designing chromophores with low-lying triplet states such that the energy relationship 2E(T1) {$\leq$} E(S1) is satisfied. Although molecules that do not fulfill this condition can also exhibit singlet fission from a higher lying or vibrationally excited singlet state, fast relaxation processes will likely reduce the singlet fission yield and complicate determination of the singlet fission mechanism.For (ii), once an appropriate chromophore has been chosen, the task of coupling two or more of them together must be done carefully. We discuss three pathways by which a dimer could undergo singlet fission: (1) A direct route in which slipped cofacial stacking is favorable under certain conditions. Cofacial stacking is common in molecular crystals, and it is likely not a coincidence that recent reports of efficient singlet fission involve slipped-stacked molecules in polycrystalline thin films. (2) A mediated route in which S1 interacts with (TT) through a virtual radical cation/anion state, which may be important in some situations. (3) A two-step route (i.e., through a real charge transfer intermediate) which others have suggested theoretically. We present data on 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPIBF) dimers that are consistent with this pathway.Finally, we review potential solar photoconversion efficiency gains utilizing singlet fission in several contexts.},

Then, we use this connection to motivate a tensor network algorithm for the simulation of multitime correlations in open systems, building on recent work where the influence functional is represented in terms of time evolving matrix product operators. By exploiting the symmetries of the influence functional, we are able to use our algorithm to achieve orders-of-magnitude improvement in the efficiency of the resulting numerical simulation. Our improved algorithm is then applied to compute exact phonon emission spectra for the spin-boson model with strong coupling, demonstrating a significant divergence from spectra derived under commonly used assumptions of memorylessness.},

However, conical intersections frequently occurring in this representation introduce nontrivial geometric or Berry phases which require a special treatment for adequate modeling of the nuclear dynamics. We analyze two approaches for nonadiabatic dynamics using the time-dependent variational principle and the adiabatic representation. The first approach employs adiabatic electronic functions with global parametric dependence on the nuclear coordinates. The second approach uses adiabatic electronic functions obtained only at the centers of moving localized nuclear basis functions (e.g., frozen-width Gaussians). Unless a gauge transformation is used to enforce single-valued boundary conditions, the first approach fails to capture the geometric phase. In contrast, the second approach accounts for the geometric phase naturally because of the absence of the global nuclear coordinate dependence in the electronic functions.},

The build-up of such patterns in experiments with electrons has been described as the ``most beautiful experiment in physics''8,9,10,11. Here, we show how a combination of nanofabrication and nano-imaging allows us to record the full two-dimensional build-up of quantum interference patterns in real time for phthalocyanine molecules and for derivatives of phthalocyanine molecules, which have masses of 514 AMU and 1,298 AMU respectively. A laser-controlled micro-evaporation source was used to produce a beam of molecules with the required intensity and coherence, and the gratings were machined in 10-nm-thick silicon nitride membranes to reduce the effect of van der Waals forces. Wide-field fluorescence microscopy detected the position of each molecule with an accuracy of 10 nm and revealed the build-up of a deterministic ensemble interference pattern from single molecules that arrived stochastically at the detector. In addition to providing this particularly clear demonstration of wave--particle duality, our approach could also be used to study larger molecules and explore the boundary between quantum and classical physics.},

Neural network potentials (NNPs) are outstanding in this field as they have shown a comparable accuracy to ab initio electronic structure calculations for reproducing potential energy surfaces while being several orders of magnitude faster. However, such NNPs can perform poorly outside their training domain and often fail catastrophically in predicting rare events in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The rare events in atomistic modeling typically include chemical bond breaking/formation, phase transitions, and materials failure, which are critical for new materials design, synthesis, and manufacturing processes. In this study, we develop an automated active learning (AL) capability by combining NNPs and one of the enhanced sampling methods, steered molecular dynamics, for capturing bond-breaking events of alkane chains to derive NNPs for targeted applications. We develop a decision engine based on configurational similarity and uncertainty quantification (UQ), using data augmentation for effective AL loops to distinguish the informative data from enhanced sampled configurations, showing that the generated data set achieves an activation energy error of less than 1 kcal mol-1. Furthermore, we have devised a strategy to alleviate training uncertainty within AL iterations through a carefully constructed data selection process that leverages an ensemble approach. Our study provides essential insight into the relationship between data and the performance of NNP for the rare event of bond breaking under mechanical loading. It highlights strategies for developing NNPs of broader materials and applications through active learning.},

Overall, our results indicate that structural fluctuations, electrostatic interactions, and short-range quantum effects can significantly modulate the model Hamiltonian parameters (site energies and couplings). We find that the specific interactions with the axial ligand and the hydrogen-bonded residues are responsible for the energy ladder, with their effects being mainly due to electrostatic interactions, but with short-range quantum contributions that are not negligible. In addition, a striking modulation of the screening effects experienced by the BChl pairs, due to the heterogeneous polarizability of the FMO and solvent environment, is observed. Finally, we find that the exciton model gives a reliable description of the delocalized excited states in the complex.},

The method relies on use of a time averaging procedure in the conventional semiclassical (SC) initial value representation (IVR) expression for the spectral density. The convergence of the SC-IVR average over the phase space of initial conditions (of classical trajectories) is greatly enhanced by time averaging and is generally achieved with as few as 1000 trajectories per degree of freedom. Furthermore, meaningful results can be obtained with only a single trajectory propagated for a long time. (For systems with chaotic dynamics, however, the phase space average converges more slowly.) Results for vibrational energy levels of H2CO,\hphantom{,}NH3,\hphantom{,}CH4, and CH2D2 are reported and compared with quantum mechanical calculations available in the literature. The accuracy of the time-averaged SC-IVR is very encouraging, with the vibrational energy levels consistently in agreement with the quantum results to a few parts in a thousand.},

The integrand of this integral is complex, i.e., has a phase, from which quantum coherence (in fact, all quantum) effects arise, but which also makes SC-IVR calculations more difficult than ordinary classical molecular dynamics simulations (the semiclassical version of the ``sign problem''). A number of approaches have been devised to ameliorate the sign problem, and here we show how a time averaging procedure---the integrand of the phase space integral is time-averaged over the classical trajectory originating from each initial condition---can be profitably used in this regard, particularly so for the calculation of spectral densities (from which vibrational energy levels can be identified). This time averaging procedure is shown to greatly reduce the number of initial conditions (i.e., the number of classical trajectories) that are needed to converge IVR phase space averages. In some cases useful results can be obtained with only one classical trajectory. Calculations are carried out for vibrational energy levels of H2 and H2O to illustrate the overall procedure.},

While SQC was shown to be rather accurate when applied to benchmark models with harmonic electronic potential energy surfaces, it was also found to become inaccurate and to suffer numerical instabilities when applied to anharmonic systems. In this paper, we propose an extended SQC (E-SQC) methodology for overcoming those discrepancies by describing the anharmonic nuclear modes, which are coupled to the electronic degrees of freedom, in terms of classical-like mapping variables. The accuracy of E-SQC relative to standard SQC is demonstrated on benchmark models with quartic and Morse potential energy surfaces.},

Signatures of this failure are the temperature dependent minimum point of the polariton peak splitting, the uneven polariton peak height at the minimum splitting, and the asymmetric shape of the polariton peaks even at the experimentally accessed ``zero-detuning'' point. Using a rather generic yet representative model of molecular vibrations, we predict the polariton response in various conditions, depending on the temperature, molecular Stokes shift and vibration frequencies, and the size of the Rabi splitting.

  abstract = {Progress in the atomic-scale modeling of matter over the past decade has been tremendous. This progress has been brought about by improvements in methods for evaluating interatomic forces that work by either solving the electronic structure problem explicitly, or by computing accurate approximations of the solution and by the development of techniques that use the Born--Oppenheimer (BO) forces to move the atoms on the BO potential energy surface. As a consequence of these developments it is now possible to identify stable or metastable states, to sample configurations consistent with the appropriate thermodynamic ensemble, and to estimate the kinetics of reactions and phase transitions. All too often, however, progress is slowed down by the bottleneck associated with implementing new optimization algorithms and/or sampling techniques into the many existing electronic-structure and empirical-potential codes. To address this problem, we are thus releasing a new version of the i-PI software. This piece of software is an easily extensible framework for implementing advanced atomistic simulation techniques using interatomic potentials and forces calculated by an external driver code. While the original version of the code (Ceriotti et al., 2014) was developed with a focus on path integral molecular dynamics techniques, this second release of i-PI not only includes several new advanced path integral methods, but also offers other classes of algorithms. In other words, i-PI is moving towards becoming a universal force engine that is both modular and tightly coupled to the driver codes that evaluate the potential energy surface and its derivatives.

Solution method: Advanced sampling methods, including path-integral molecular dynamics techniques, are implemented in a Python interface. Any electronic structure code can be patched to receive the atomic coordinates from the Python interface, and to return the forces and energy that are used to integrate the equations of motion, optimize atomic geometries, etc. Restrictions: This code does not compute interatomic potentials, although the distribution includes sample driver codes that can be used to test different techniques using a few simple model force fields.},

  abstract = {Intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) impacts the dynamics of reactions in a profound way. Theoretical and experimental studies are increasingly indicating that accounting for the finite rate of energy flow is critical for uncovering the correct reaction mechanisms and calculating accurate rates. This requires an explicit understanding of the influence and interplay of the various anharmonic (Fermi) resonances that lead to the coupling of the vibrational modes. In this regard, the local random matrix theory (LRMT) and the related Bose-statistics triangle rule (BSTR) model have emerged as powerful and predictive quantum theories for IVR. In this Perspective we highlight the close correspondence between LRMT and the classical phase space perspective on IVR, primarily using model Hamiltonians with three degrees of freedom. Our purpose for this is threefold. First, this clearly brings out the extent to which IVR pathways are essentially classical, and hence crucial towards attempts to control IVR. Second, given that LRMT and BSTR are designed to be applicable for large molecules, the exquisite correspondence observed even for small molecules allows for insights into the quantum ergodicity transition. Third, we showcase the power of modern nonlinear dynamics methods in analysing high dimensional phase spaces, thereby extending the deep insights into IVR that were earlier gained for systems with effectively two degrees of freedom. We begin with a brief overview of recent examples where IVR plays an important role and conclude by mentioning the outstanding problems and the potential connections to issues of interest in other fields.},

  abstract = {Multireference calculations can provide accurate information of systems with strong correlation, which have increasing importance in the development of new molecules and materials. However, selecting a suitable active space for multireference calculations is nontrivial, and the selection of an unsuitable active space can sometimes lead to results that are not physically meaningful. Active space selection often requires significant human input, and the selection that leads to reasonable results often goes beyond chemical intuition. In this work, we have developed and evaluated two protocols for automated selection of the active space for multireference calculations based on a simple physical observable, the dipole moment, for molecules with nonzero ground-state dipole moments. One protocol is based on the ground-state dipole moment, and the other is based on the excited-state dipole moments. To evaluate the protocols, we constructed a dataset of 1275 active spaces from 25 molecules, each with 51 active space sizes considered, and have mapped out the relationship between the active space, dipole moments, and vertical excitation energies. We have demonstrated that, within this dataset, our protocols allow one to choose among a number of accessible active spaces one that is likely to give reasonable vertical excitation energies, especially for the first three excitations, with no parameters manually decided by the user. We show that, with large active spaces removed from consideration, the accuracy is similar and the time-to-solution can be reduced by more than 10 fold. We also show that the protocols can be applied to potential energy surface scans and determining the spin states of transition metal oxides.},

The propagator is obtained in the form of an expansion in ℏ, in which the lowest-order term is the HK formula. Thus, the result extends the HK approximation to higher orders in ℏ. Examination of the various terms shows that the expansion is a uniform asymptotic series and establishes the HK formula as a uniform semiclassical approximation. Successive terms in the series should allow one to improve the accuracy of the HK approximation for small ℏ in a systematic and purely semiclassical manner, analogous to a higher-order WKB treatment of time-independent wave functions.},

J(\${\o}mega\$) describes the frequency-dependent coupling of the system to the bath and is an important component in calculations of excitation energy transfer times. On the basis of the shape of experimental J(\${\o}mega\$) obtained for several photosynthetic complexes, we argue that the shape of J(\${\o}mega\$) strongly depends on the pigment--protein complex. We show that many densities (especially the Drude--Lorentz/constant damping Brownian oscillator) display qualitatively wrong behavior when compared to experiment. Because of divergence of J(\${\o}mega\$) at zero frequency, the Brownian oscillator cannot fit a single-site spectrum correctly. It is proposed that a log-normal distribution can be used to fit experimental data and exhibits desired attributes for a physically meaningful phonon J(\${\o}mega\$), in contrast to several commonly used spectral densities which exhibit low-frequency behavior in qualitative disagreement with experiment. We anticipate that the log-normal J(\${\o}mega\$) function proposed in this work will be further tested in theoretical modeling of both time- and frequency-domain data.},

Advances in real space methods include techniques for accurate computation of bandgaps and for systematically improving the nodal surface of ground state wavefunctions. Results of these calculations can be used to validate application of more approximate electronic structure methods, including GW and density functional based techniques. To provide an improved foundation for these calculations, we utilize a new set of correlation-consistent effective core potentials (pseudopotentials) that are more accurate than previous sets; these can also be applied in quantum-chemical and other many-body applications, not only QMC.

  abstract = {The hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method is a numerically exact open quantum system dynamics approach. The method is rooted in an exponential expansion of the bath correlation function, which in essence strategically reshapes a continuous environment into a set of effective bath modes that allow for more efficient cutoff at finite temperatures. Based on this understanding, one can map the HEOM method into a Schr{\"o}dinger-like equation, with a non-Hermitian super-Hamiltonian for an extended wave function being the tensor product of the central system wave function and the Fock state of these effective bath modes. In this work, we explore the possibility of representing the extended wave function as a tree tensor network state (TTNS) and the super-Hamiltonian as a tree tensor network operator of the same structure as the TTNS, as well as the application of a time propagation algorithm using the time-dependent variational principle. Our benchmark calculations based on the spin-boson model with a slow-relaxing bath show that the proposed HEOM+TTNS approach yields consistent results with those of the conventional HEOM method, while the computation is considerably sped up. In addition, the simulation with a genuine TTNS is four times faster than a one-dimensional matrix product state decomposition scheme.},

This encompasses avenues for accessing Green's functions, techniques for extrapolation and interpolation, as well as the incorporation of symmetries and a variety of parallelization strategies.

Our iterative full counting statistics path integral (iFCSPI) approach extends a previously well-established influence functional path integral method, by going beyond reduced system dynamics to provide the cumulant generating function of heat exchange. The method is straightforward; we implement it for the nonequilibrium spin boson model to calculate transient and long-time observables, focusing on the steady-state heat current flowing through the system under a temperature difference. Results are compared to perturbative treatments and demonstrate good agreement in the appropriate limits. The challenge of converging nonequilibrium quantities, currents and high order cumulants, is discussed in detail. The iFCSPI, a numerically exact technique, naturally captures strong system-bath coupling and non-Markovian effects of the environment. As such, it is a promising tool for probing fundamental questions in quantum transport and quantum thermodynamics.},

On the basis of the relation between such a general correlation function and that for the position variable, and the analytical result for the relation of quantum and classical correlation functions of position for harmonic baths, we develop an approximate expression for the quantum correction to the general classical correlation function as an expansion in the quantum correction. The quantum corrected correlation function only requires classical correlation functions and their derivatives with respect to time and temperature. Hence, the result can be implemented directly using only computer simulated classical data. Application to analytically solved model problems involving harmonic baths demonstrates that the method is accurate both for highly nonlinear coupling and surprisingly small temperature.},

Due to the large number of spectrally overlapping pigments in a typical photosynthetic complex, experimental methods often fail to unambiguously identify individual chromophore properties. Here, we report a first-principles-based modeling protocol capable of predicting properties of pigments in protein environment to a high precision. The technique was applied to successfully uncover electronic properties of the Fenna--Matthews--Olson (FMO) pigment--protein complex. Each of the three subunits of the FMO complex contains eight strongly coupled bacteriochlorophyll a (BChl a) pigments. The excitonic structure of FMO can be described by an electronic Hamiltonian containing excitation (site) energies of BChl a pigments and electronic couplings between them. Several such Hamiltonians have been developed in the past based on the information from various spectroscopic measurements of FMO; however, fine details of the excitonic structure and energy transfer in FMO, especially assignments of short-lived high-energy sites, remain elusive. Utilizing polarizable embedding quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics with the effective fragment potentials, we computed the electronic Hamiltonian of FMO that is in general agreement with previously reported empirical Hamiltonians and quantitatively reproduces experimental absorption and circular dichroism spectra of the FMO protein. The developed computational protocol is sufficiently simple and can be utilized for predictive modeling of other wild-type and mutated photosynthetic pigment--protein complexes.},

  abstract = {The past decade has seen a great increase in the application of high-throughput computation to a variety of important problems in chemistry. However, one area which has been resistant to the high-throughput approach is multireference wave function methods, in large part due to the technicalities of setting up these calculations and in particular the not always intuitive challenge of active space selection. As we look toward a future of applying high-throughput computation to all areas of chemistry, it is important to prepare these methods for large-scale automation. Here, we propose a ranked-orbital approach to select active spaces with the goal of standardizing multireference methods for high-throughput computation. This method allows for the meaningful comparison of different active space selection schemes and orbital localizations, and we demonstrate the utility of this approach across 1120 multireference calculations for the excitation energies of small molecules. Our results reveal that it is helpful to distinguish the method used to generate orbitals from the method of ranking orbitals in terms of importance for the active space. Additionally, we propose our own orbital ranking scheme that estimates the importance of an orbital for the active space through a pair-interaction framework from orbital energies and features of the Hartree--Fock exchange matrix. We call this new scheme the ``approximate pair coefficient'' (APC) method and we show that it performs quite well for the test systems presented.},

The hierarchy of the equations of motion of the Green'f functions is decoupled at a stage one-step further than Tyablikov's decoupling. The thermal average of the spin component, {$\ll$} Sz \&gt;, is set to zero, becaure the long-range order does not exist in one dimension. Instead, our Green's functions are expressed in terms of the correlation functions cn {$\equiv$}4{$\ll$} S0zSnz \&gt;. The Green's function is essentially of the form representing undamped spin waves, whose spactrum depends on c1, c2 and one more parameter. They are determined by the requirement that c1 and c2 should be self-consistent and that c0 should be unity. The self-consistency equations have been solved analytically at high- and low-temperature limits, and also solved numerically in the whole range of the temperature. Thermodynamic quantities have been calculated using these solutions.It has turned out that the theory gives the correct high-temperature expansion for the thermodynamic quantities and the correlation functions. The latter is expressed by cn = (J / 4 kBT )n. In the case of ferromagnetic coupling, the correlation function cn at T = 0 is equal to 1/3 for all n's. This is what is expected from the correct ground state of the ferromagnetic Heisenberg system. The spin-wave spectrum at T = 0 also agrees with the correct one. At T {$\ll$}J/ kB, we find that the specific heat goes as T1/2 and the susceptibility goes as T-2. The gross feature of the temperature-dependence of the thermodynamic quantities agrees with Bonner and Fisher. In the case of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, we find c1 = -0.55407 and c2 = 0.16100 at T = 0, which are fairly close to the exact values. The thermodynamic quantities are also in gross agreement with Bonner and Fisher.},

The expansion coefficients of the initial superposition are updated after each semiclassical propagation period by implementing the Husimi Transform analytically in the basis of closely overlapping Gaussians. An advantage of the resulting time-sliced thawed Gaussian (TSTG) method is that it allows for full-quantum dynamics propagation without any kind of multidimensional integral calculation, or inversion of overlap matrices.

  abstract = {Molecules that undergo singlet fission, converting singlet excitons into pairs of triplet excitons, have potential as photovoltaic materials. The possible advantages of endothermic singlet fission (enhanced use of photon energy and larger triplet energies for coupling with common absorbers) motivated us to assess the role of exciton delocalization in the activation of this process. Here we report the synthesis of a series of linear perylene oligomers that undergo endothermic singlet fission and have endothermicities in the range 5--10\,kBT at room temperature in solution. We study these compounds using transient spectroscopy and modelling to unravel the singlet and triplet dynamics. We show that the minimal number of coupled chromophores needed to undergo endothermic singlet fission is three, which provides sufficient statistical space for triplet excitons to separate and avoid annihilation---and a subsequent fast return to the singlet state. Our data additionally suggest that torsional motion of chromophores about the molecular axis following triplet-pair separation contributes to the increase in entropy, thus lengthening the triplet lifetime in longer oligomers.},

The hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) provide a unifying theory, which allows one to study the combined effects of system-environment dissipation and non-Markovian memory without making restrictive assumptions about weak or strong couplings or separability of vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom. With increasing system size the exact solution of the open quantum system dynamics requires memory and compute resources beyond a single compute node. To overcome this barrier, we developed a scalable variant of HEOM. Our distributed memory HEOM, DM-HEOM, is a universal tool for open quantum system dynamics. It is used to accurately compute all experimentally accessible time- and frequency-resolved processes in light-harvesting molecular complexes with arbitrary system-environment couplings for a wide range of temperatures and complex sizes. {\copyright} 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

When the quantum observables generate a Lie group G and the states are taken as functions on an appropriate homogeneous quotient space M := G/G0 under G, they can be equipped with a classical Poisson bracket which reproduces the commutators of the Lie group. The quantum system maps into a classical system whose equations of motion are governed by the expectation value H of the quantum Hamiltonian H.

Recent experiments point toward the possibility of memory effects in this process and require one to consider time nonlocal propagation techniques. The hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) were proposed by Ishizaki and Fleming to describe the site-dependent reorganization dynamics of protein environments (J. Chem. Phys. 2009, 130, 234111), which plays a significant role in photosynthetic electronic energy transfer. HEOM are often used as a reference for other approximate methods but have been implemented only for small systems due to their adverse computational scaling with the system size. Here, we show that HEOM are also solvable for larger systems, since the underlying algorithm is ideally suited for the usage of graphics processing units (GPU). The tremendous reduction in computational time due to the GPU allows us to perform a systematic study of the energy-transfer efficiency in the Fenna--Matthews--Olson (FMO) light-harvesting complex at physiological temperature under full consideration of memory effects. We find that approximative methods differ qualitatively and quantitatively from the HEOM results and discuss the importance of finite temperature to achieving high energy-transfer efficiencies.},

In particular, we consider Monte Carlo quadratures based either on the initial Husimi density or on its square root as possible and most natural sampling densities. We prove analytical convergence error estimates and validate them with numerical experiments on the harmonic oscillator and on a series of Morse potentials with increasing anharmonicity. In all cases, sampling from the square root of Husimi density leads to faster convergence of the wavefunction.},

These molecular excitons are a direct result of exceptionally densely packed pigments in photosynthetic proteins. The main light-harvesting complexes of diatoms, known as fucoxanthin?chlorophyll proteins (FCPs), are an exception, displaying surprisingly weak excitonic coupling between their chlorophyll (Chl) a?s, despite a high pigment density. Here, we show, using single-molecule spectroscopy, that the FCP complexes of Cyclotella meneghiniana switch frequently into stable, strongly emissive states shifted 4?10 nm toward the red. A few percent of isolated FCPa complexes and ?20\% of isolated FCPb complexes, on average, were observed to populate these previously unobserved states, percentages that agree with the steady-state fluorescence spectra of FCP ensembles. Thus, the complexes use their enhanced sensitivity to static disorder to increase their light-harvesting capability in a number of ways. A disordered exciton model based on the structure of the main plant light-harvesting complex explains the red-shifted emission by strong localization of the excitation energy on a single Chl a pigment in the terminal emitter domain due to very specific pigment orientations. We suggest that the specific construction of FCP gives the complex a unique strategy to ensure that its light-harvesting function remains robust in the fluctuating protein environment despite limited excitonic interactions.},

  abstract = {The ability to control single molecule electronic conductance is imperative for achieving functional molecular electronics applications such as insulation, switching, and energy conversion. Quantum interference (QI) effects are generally used to control electronic transmission through single molecular junctions by tuning the molecular structure or the position of the anchoring group(s) in the molecule. While previous studies focussed on the QI between {$\sigma$} and/or {$\pi$} channels of the molecular backbone, here, we show that single molecule electronic devices can be designed based on QI effects originating from the interactions of anchoring groups. Furthermore, while previous studies have concentrated on the QI mostly in conjugated/cyclic systems, our study showcases that QI effects can be harnessed even in the simplest acyclic aliphatic systems---alkanedithiols, alkanediamines, and alkanediselenols. We identify band gap state resonances in the transmission spectrum of these molecules whose positions and intensities depend on the chain length, and anchoring group sensitive QI between the nearly degenerate molecular orbitals localized on the anchoring groups. We predict that these QI features can be harnessed through an external mechanical stimulus to tune the charge transport properties of single molecules in the break-junction experiments.},

Rather than propagating the many-particle wavefunction or density matrix in time in the usual stepwise fashion, the MPI scheme proceeds by sequentially integrating over each unit after linking its quantum paths to those of its neighbour and leads to linear scaling with system length. This paper shows that the linking matrix can be further decomposed into a diagonal matrix and a product of low-dimensional matrices, which can be applied sequentially. This factorisation changes the cost scaling from L2 to LlogL, where L is the number of quantum paths, leading to dramatic savings that are analogous to those attained by the fast Fourier transform algorithm and allowing application of the MPI procedure to systems with larger units and to longer propagation times. Applications to spin chains and to electron-vibration dynamics in a large molecular aggregate illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm.},

We also identify a high-frequency vibronic mode which is primarily responsible for additional oscillatory features that exhibit variable temperature sensitivity dependent on aggregate length.

Using a model two-state system with displaced harmonic potential surfaces, we show analytically that the FC-HT interference gives rise to asymmetric intensity modification, which has the same sign for all transitions on one side of the 0--0 absorption line and the opposite sign in the equivalent fluorescence transitions, while the trend is exactly reversed for all transitions on the other side the 0--0 line. We examine the dependence of the absorption--emission asymmetry on the mode frequency, Huang--Rhys factor, and dipole moment parameters to show the recovery of symmetry with particular combinations of parameters and a crossover from fluorescence to absorption dominance. We illustrate the analytical predictions through numerically exact calculations in models of one and two discrete vibrational modes and in the presence of a harmonic dissipative bath. In addition to homogeneous broadening effects, we identify large asymmetric shifts of absorption and emission band maxima, which can produce the illusion of unequal frequencies in the ground and excited potential surfaces as well as a nontrivial modulation of spectral asymmetry by temperature, which results from the enhancement of transitions on one side of the 0--0 line. These findings will aid the interpretation of experimental spectra in HT-active molecular systems.},

Generic trends, as well as features specific to the vibrational characteristics of the molecules, are identified. Weak exciton-vibration (EV) interaction leads to compact, near-Gaussian densities on each electronic state, whose peak follows primarily a classical trajectory on a torus, while noncompact densities and nonlinear peak evolution are observed with strong EV coupling. Interaction with many intramolecular modes and increasing aggregate size smear, shift, and damp these dynamical features.},

The calculations employ a Frenkel exciton Hamiltonian where the ground and excited electronic states of each molecular unit are coupled to 28 intramolecular normal mode vibrations at various temperatures. The electronic populations exhibit strong damping effects, a lengthening of the EET time scale, and complex dynamical patterns, which depend on aggregate length, temperature, as well as electronic and vibrational initial conditions and which are not additive. The early evolution is dominated by high-frequency vibrational modes, but all modes are responsible for the observed dynamics after the initial 25 fs. Overall, we observe significant changes in the electronic populations upon varying the temperature between 0 and 600 K. With a Franck--Condon (FC) initial excitation, a strongly coupled vibrational mode introduces new peaks to the dimer populations, which show very weak temperature sensitivity. The first of these peaks is also seen in the long aggregate, but subsequent recurrences appear strongly quenched and merged. These structures are drastically altered if a non-FC initial condition is assumed. Additional insights are obtained from the diagonal elements of the dimer electronic-vibrational reduced density matrix. We find that the vibronic peaks result from depletion of the crossing region during the early coherent evolution of the vibrational density away from the crossing point, which allows the premature back-transfer of excitation to the initially excited unit.},

In the SMatPI module, the dynamics within the entanglement interval can be computed using QuAPI, the blip sum, time evolving matrix product operators, or the quantum--classical path integral method. These methods have distinct convergence characteristics and their combination allows a user to access a variety of regimes. The extended system module provides the user with two algorithms of the modular path integral method, applicable to quantum spin chains or excitonic molecular aggregates.

Molecular vibrations enable the 1-ps flow of energy to the B850 states, which would otherwise be kinetically inaccessible. A classical treatment of the vibrations leads to uniform equilibrium distribution of the excitation, with only 67\% transferred to the inner ring.

Equations of motion based on the Dirac-Frenkel time-dependent variational principle is derived by using the tangent space projection and the projector-splitting technique for the MPS, which have been recently developed. The mean-field operators, which appear in the equation of motion of the MCTDH single particle functions, are written in terms of the MPS form and efficiently evaluated by a sweep algorithm that is similar to the density-matrix renormalized group sweep.

  abstract = {We study the population dynamics and quantum transport efficiency of a multi-site dissipative system driven by a random telegraph noise (RTN) by using a variational polaron master equation for both linear chain and ring configurations. By using two different environment descriptions---RTN only and a thermal bath+RTN---we show that the presence of the classical noise has a non-trivial role on quantum transport. We observe that there exist large areas of parameter space where the combined bath+RTN influence is clearly beneficial for populating the target state of the transport, and for average trapping time and transport efficiency when accounting for the presence of the reaction center via the use of the sink. This result holds for both of the considered intra-site coupling configurations including a chain and ring. In general, our formalism and achieved results provide a platform for engineering and characterizing efficient quantum transport in multi-site systems both for realistic environments and engineered systems.},

The simulations rely on a tensor network representation of the quantum states as matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network states. Written in the Julia programming language, MPSDynamics.jl is a versatile open-source package providing a choice of several variants of the Time-Dependent Variational Principle method for time evolution (including novel bond-adaptive one-site algorithms). The package also provides strong support for the measurement of single and multi-site observables, as well as the storing and logging of data, which makes it a useful tool for the study of many-body physics. It currently handles long-range interactions, time-dependent Hamiltonians, multiple environments, bosonic and fermionic environments, and joint system--environment observables.},

  abstract = {A highly accurate equation of state (EOS) for chain molecules formed from spherical segments interacting through Mie potentials (i.e., a generalized Lennard-Jones form with variable repulsive and attractive exponents) is presented. The quality of the theoretical description of the vapour-liquid equilibria (coexistence densities and vapour pressures) and the second-derivative thermophysical properties (heat capacities, isobaric thermal expansivities, and speed of sound) are critically assessed by comparison with molecular simulation and with experimental data of representative real substances. Our new EOS represents a notable improvement with respect to previous versions of the statistical associating fluid theory for variable range interactions (SAFT-VR) of the generic Mie form. The approach makes rigorous use of the Barker and Henderson high-temperature perturbation expansion up to third order in the free energy of the monomer Mie system. The radial distribution function of the reference monomer fluid, which is a prerequisite for the representation of the properties of the fluid of Mie chains within a Wertheim first-order thermodynamic perturbation theory (TPT1), is calculated from a second-order expansion. The resulting SAFT-VR Mie EOS can now be applied to molecular fluids characterized by a broad range of interactions spanning from soft to very repulsive and short-ranged Mie potentials. A good representation of the corresponding molecular-simulation data is achieved for model monomer and chain fluids. When applied to the particular case of the ubiquitous Lennard-Jones potential, our rigorous description of the thermodynamic properties is of equivalent quality to that obtained with the empirical EOSs for LJ monomer (EOS of Johnson et al.) and LJ chain (soft-SAFT) fluids. A key feature of our reformulated SAFT-VR approach is the greatly enhanced accuracy in the near-critical region for chain molecules. This attribute, combined with the accurate modeling of second-derivative properties, allows for a much improved global representation of the thermodynamic properties and fluid-phase equilibria of pure fluids and their mixtures.},

  abstract = {Quantum master equations (QMEs) provide a general framework for describing electronic dynamics within a complex molecular system. Off-diagonal QMEs (OD-QMEs) correspond to a family of QMEs that describe the electronic dynamics in the interaction picture based on treating the off-diagonal coupling terms between electronic states as a small perturbation within the framework of second-order perturbation theory. The fact that OD-QMEs are given in terms of the interaction picture makes it non-trivial to obtain Schr{\"o}dinger picture electronic coherences from them. A key experimental quantity that relies on the ability to obtain accurate Schr{\"o}dinger picture electronic coherences is the absorption spectrum. In this paper, we propose using a recently introduced procedure for extracting Schr{\"o}dinger picture electronic coherences from interaction picture inputs to calculate electronic absorption spectra from the electronic dynamics generated by OD-QMEs. The accuracy of the absorption spectra obtained this way is studied in the context of a biexciton benchmark model, by comparing spectra calculated based on time-local and time-nonlocal OD-QMEs to spectra calculated based on a Redfield-type QME and the non-perturbative and quantum-mechanically exact hierarchical equations of motion method.},

Therefore, since an arbitrarily small step size can be chosen, the complex-step approach can achieve near analytical accuracy. However, for second derivatives straight implementation of the complex-step approach does suffer from roundoff errors. Therefore, an arbitrarily small step size cannot be chosen. In this paper the standard complex-step approach is expanded by using general complex-step sizes to provide a wider range of accuracy for both the first- and second-derivative approximations. Even higher accuracy formulations are obtained by repetitively applying Richardson extrapolations. The new extensions can allow the use of one step size to provide optimal accuracy for both derivative approximations.},

These methods involve step-by-step propagation of a generalized multi-time reduced density matrix with a propagator that includes influence functional interactions that span the bath-induced memory length. Low-frequency baths lead to long memory that can span many time steps, necessitating the use of filtering procedures that select and store only statistically significant path segments, avoiding storage of the entire sparse propagator. The present paper further enhances the iterative path integral methodology through a deterministic procedure that identifies at the start of the calculation all memory-length path segments whose weights exceed a chosen threshold and builds the propagator matrix for use in all propagation steps. A binning procedure allows efficient pairing of path segments required in the construction of the propagator. Additional savings are achieved via a simple criterion for assessing the adequacy of a chosen path selection threshold prior to propagation. Application to a tight-binding model for charge transfer in extended systems reveals the important role of bath-induced memory on the dynamics of these systems.},

However, when the coupling to the environment is ultra-strong the ground-state is expected to become dressed with virtual excitations. This regime is difficult to capture with some traditional methods because of the explosion in the number of Matsubara frequencies, i.e., exponential terms in the free-bath correlation function. To access this regime we generalize both the hierarchical equations of motion and pseudomode methods, taking into account this explosion using only a biexponential fitting function. We compare these methods to the reaction coordinate mapping, which helps show how these sometimes neglected Matsubara terms are important to regulate detailed balance and prevent the unphysical emission of virtual excitations. For the pseudomode method, we present a general proof of validity for the use of superficially unphysical Matsubara-modes, which mirror the mathematical essence of the Matsubara frequencies.},

Earlier work has derived semiclassical or purely classical expressions for the influence functional from the environment, which should be sufficiently accurate for many situations, but the evaluation of quantum-(semi)classical path integral (QCPI) expressions has not been practical for large-scale simulation because the interaction with the environment introduces couplings nonlocal in time. In this work, we analyze the nature of the effects on a system from its environment in light of the observation [N. Makri, J. Chem. Phys. 109, 2994 (1998)] that true nonlocality in the path integral is a strictly quantum mechanical phenomenon. If the environment is classical, the path integral becomes local and can be evaluated in a stepwise fashion along classical trajectories of the free solvent. This simple ``classical path'' limit of QCPI captures fully the decoherence of the system via a classical mechanism. Small corrections to the classical path QCPI approximation may be obtained via an inexpensive random hop QCPI model, which accounts for some ``back reaction'' effects. Exploiting the finite length of nonlocality, we argue that further inclusion of quantum decoherence is possible via an iterative evaluation of the path integral. Finally, we show that the sum of the quantum amplitude factors with respect to the system paths leads to a smooth integrand as a function of trajectory initial conditions, allowing the use of Monte Carlo methods for the multidimensional phase space integral.},

We obtain quantum-classical path integral (QCPI) expressions in which the trajectories can undergo transitions to other quantum states at regular time intervals, but the cumulative probability of these transitions is governed by the local strength of the state-to-state coupling as well as the magnitude of the solvent reorganization energy. If quantum effects in the coordinates of the environment are relatively weak, an inexpensive random hop approximation leads to accurate descriptions of the dynamics. We describe a systematic iterative scheme for including quantum mechanical corrections for the solvent by gradually accounting for nonlocal ``quantum memory'' effects. As the length of the included memory approaches the decoherence time of the environment, the iterative QCPI procedure converges to the full QCPI result. The methodology is illustrated with application to dissipative symmetric and asymmetric two-level systems.},

In the second case, we are able to reproduce accurate IR spectra as demonstrated by a calculation of the IR spectrum of the water molecule, which is within 4\% of the exact intensity. Our time averaged IR spectra can be directly compared to time averaged semiclassical power spectra as shown in an application to the CO2~molecule, which points out the differences between IR and power spectra and demonstrates that our new approach can identify active IR transitions correctly. Overall, the method features excellent accuracy in calculating absorption intensities and provides estimates for the frequencies of vibrations in agreement with the corresponding power spectra. In perspective, this work opens up the possibility to interface the new method with the semiclassical techniques developed for power spectra, such as the divide-and-conquer one, to get accurate IR spectra of complex and high-dimensional molecular systems.},

  abstract = {The multilayer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) method and the density matrix renormalisation group (DMRG) are powerful workhorses applied mostly in different scientific fields. Although both methods are based on tensor network states, very different mathematical languages are used for describing them. This severely limits knowledge transfer and sometimes leads to re-inventions of ideas well known in the other field. Here, we review ML-MCTDH and DMRG theory using both MCTDH expressions and tensor network diagrams. We derive the ML-MCTDH equations of motions using diagrams and compare them with time-dependent and time-independent DMRG algorithms. We further review two selected recent advancements. The first advancement is related to optimising unoccupied single-particle functions in MCTDH, which corresponds to subspace enrichment in the DMRG. The second advancement is related to finding optimal tree structures and on highlighting similarities and differences of tensor networks used in MCTDH and DMRG theories. We hope that this contribution will foster more fruitful cross-fertilisation of ideas between ML-MCTDH and DMRG.},

  abstract = {Ab initio multiple spawning (AIMS) offers a reliable strategy to describe the excited-state dynamics and nonadiabatic processes of molecular systems. AIMS represents nuclear wavefunctions as linear combinations of traveling, coupled Gaussians called trajectory basis functions (TBFs) and uses a spawning algorithm to increase as needed the size of this basis set during nonadiabatic transitions. While the success of AIMS resides in this spawning algorithm, the dramatic increase in TBFs generated by multiple crossings between electronic states can rapidly lead to intractable dynamics. In this Communication, we introduce a new flavor of AIMS, coined ab initio multiple spawning with informed stochastic selections (AIMSWISS), which proposes a parameter-free strategy to beat the growing number of TBFs in an AIMS dynamics while preserving its accurate description of nonadiabatic transitions. The performance of AIMSWISS is validated against the photodynamics of ethylene, cyclopropanone, and fulvene. This technique, built upon the recently developed stochastic-selection AIMS, is intended to serve as a computationally affordable starting point for multiple spawning simulations.},

We consider the first 500~fs of relaxation following photoexcitation to the S2 state and predict the corresponding time-resolved electron-diffraction signal that will be measured by the planned experiment. 397 ab~initio trajectories were obtained on the fly with state-averaged complete active space self-consistent field using a (12,11) active space. To obtain an estimate of the potential systematic error, 198 of the trajectories were calculated using an aug-cc-pVDZ basis set and 199 with a 6-31+G* basis set. MASH is a recently proposed independent trajectory method for simulating nonadiabatic dynamics, originally derived for two-state problems. As there are three relevant electronic states in this system, we used a newly developed multi-state generalization of MASH for the simulation: the uncoupled spheres multi-state MASH method (unSMASH). This study, therefore, serves both as an investigation of the photodissociation dynamics of cyclobutanone, and also as a demonstration of the applicability of unSMASH to ab~initio simulations. In line with previous experimental studies, we observe that the simulated dynamics is dominated by three sets of dissociation products, C3H6 + CO, C2H4 + C2H2O, and C2H4 + CH2 + CO, and we interpret our predicted electron-diffraction signal in terms of the key features of the associated dissociation pathways.},

In the usual approach the ``bath'' variables responsible for the fluctuating frequency are treated classically, leading to a classical time-correlation function. Alternatively, sometimes a quantum correction appropriate for relatively high temperatures is included, which adds an imaginary part to the classical time-correlation function. This approach, although appealing, does not satisfy detailed balance. One can consider a similar correction, but where detailed balance is satisfied, by using the harmonic quantum correction factor. In this article, we compare these approaches for a model system and two realistic examples. Our conclusion is that for linear spectroscopy the classical result is usually adequate, whereas for nonlinear spectroscopy it can be more important to include quantum corrections.},

A simple model is also presented that enables detailed analysis of the shortcomings of standard MD-based excitation energy fluctuation correlation function approaches. The method introduced here avoids these problems, and its reliability is demonstrated in accurate predictions for bacteriochlorophyll molecules in the Fenna--Matthews--Olson pigment--protein complex, where excellent agreement with experimental spectral densities is found.

The resulting fifth-order-scaling methods, {$\kappa$}-OOMP2 and {$\sigma$}-OOMP2, have been examined for bond-breaking, thermochemistry, nonbonded interactions, and biradical problems. Both methods with strong enough regularization restore restricted to unrestricted instability (i.e., Coulson--Fischer points) that unregularized OOMP2 lacks when breaking bonds in H2, C2H6, C2H4, and C2H2. The training of the {$\kappa$} and {$\sigma$} regularization parameters was performed with the W4-11 set. We further developed scaled correlation energy variants, {$\kappa$}-S-OOMP2 and {$\sigma$}-S-OOMP2, by training on the TAE140 subset of the W4-11 set. Those new OOMP2 methods were tested on the RSE43 set and the TA13 set where unmodified OOMP2 itself performs very well. The modifications we made were found insignificant in these data sets. Furthermore, we tested the new OOMP2 methods on singlet biradicaloids using Yamaguchi's approximate spin-projection. Unlike the unregularized OOMP2, which fails to converge these systems due to the singularity, we show that regularized OOMP2 methods successfully capture strong biradicaloid characters. While further assessment on larger data sets is desirable, {$\kappa$}-OOMP2 with {$\kappa$} = 1.45 Eh--1 appears to combine favorable recovery of Coulson--Fischer points with good numerical performance.},

Two-color transient absorption at 13?fs time resolution are measured to confirm the result.

HRFs calculated by density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT reproduce the experiment adequately. This fluorescence-based method provides a unique and direct way to obtain the vibrational spectrum of a molecule in an electronic excited state and the HRFs, as well as the dynamics of excited states, and it might provide information on the structure of an excited state through the HRFs.},

We have also confirmed that long-lived quantum beatings originate from vibration, while short-lived electronic coherence still persists. Furthermore, although the electronic resonance mode speeds up the rephasing dynamics, it is not directly proportional to the coupling strength.

  abstract = {Recent experimental and theoretical works have made much progress toward understanding nonequilibrium phenomena in thermalizing systems, which act as thermal baths for their small subsystems, and many-body localized systems, which fail to do so. The description of time evolution in many-body systems is generally challenging due to the dynamical generation of quantum entanglement. In this work, we introduce an approach to study quantum many-body dynamics, inspired by the Feynman-Vernon influence functional. Focusing on a family of interacting, Floquet spin chains, we consider a Keldysh path-integral description of the dynamics. The central object in our approach is the influence matrix, which describes the effect of the system on the dynamics of a local subsystem. For translationally invariant models, we formulate a self-consistency equation for the influence matrix. For certain special values of the model parameters, we obtain an exact solution which represents a perfect dephaser (PD). Physically, a PD corresponds to a many-body system that acts as a perfectly Markovian bath on itself: at each period, it measures every spin. For the models considered here, we establish that PD points include dual-unitary circuits investigated in recent works. In the vicinity of PD points, the system is not perfectly Markovian, but rather acts as a bath with a short memory time. In this case, we demonstrate that the self-consistency equation can be solved using matrix-product states (MPS) methods, as the influence matrix temporal entanglement is low. A combination of analytical insights and MPS computations allows us to characterize the structure of the influence matrix in terms of an effective ``statistical-mechanics'' description. We finally illustrate the predictive power of this description by analytically computing how quickly an embedded impurity spin thermalizes. The influence matrix approach formulated here provides an intuitive view of the quantum many-body dynamics problem, opening a path to constructing models of thermalizing dynamics that are solvable or can be efficiently treated by MPS-based methods and to further characterizing quantum ergodicity or lack thereof.},

The electronic structure and excited-state deactivation pathways of the different polymorphs were examined by transient absorption spectroscopy, conductive probe atomic force microscopy, and molecular modeling. We find that VSA initially converts amorphous films into mixtures of H- and J-polymorphs and promotes further conversion from H to J with longer VSA times. Though both polymorphs exhibit efficient SF to form coupled triplets, free triplet yields are higher in J-polymorph films compared to mixed films because coupling in J-aggregates is lower and, in turn, more favorable for triplet decoupling.},

Here, the SQC/MM methodology is applied to ultrafast exciton dynamics in a Frenkel/site-exciton model of oligothiophene (OT) as a model of organic semiconductor polymers. In order to keep the electronic representation as compact and efficient as possible, the adiabatic version of the MM Hamiltonian was employed, with dynamical calculations carried out in the recently developed ``kinematic momentum'' representation, from which site/monomer-specific (diabatic) excitation probabilities were extracted using a new procedure developed in this work. The SQC/MM simulation results are seen to describe coherent exciton transport driven by planarization of a central torsion defect in the OT oligomer as well as to capture exciton self-trapping effects in good agreement with benchmark quantum calculations using the multi-layer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree approach. The SQC/MM calculations are also seen to significantly outperform the standard Ehrenfest approach, which shows serious discrepancies. These results are encouraging, not only because they illustrate a significant further application of the SQC/MM approach and its utility, but because they strongly suggest that classical mechanical simulations (with the potential for linear scaling efficiency) can be used to capture, quantitatively, important dynamical features of electronic excitation energy transfer in semiconducting polymers.},

  abstract = {As a promising layered electrode material, TiS2-based capacitive deionization (CDI) devices for water desalination have attracted significant attention. However, TiS2/H2O interfacial features, potentially important for device optimization, remain unidentified. Using Deep Potential Molecular Dynamics (DPMD), we characterized distinct aqueous interfaces introduced by four TiS2 terminations expected to be present as water intercalates into TiS2, namely, Armchair, Zigzag, Zigzag-L, and Zigzag-R. First, we assessed important representative physical properties of the system to validate the deep potentials (DPs). DPMD simulations agree well with experiments and first-principles simulations, suggesting the DPs are accurate and reliable. Subsequent simulations of these TiS2/water interfaces revealed how TiS2 surface termination influences the structure of interfacial water. This effect is most evident in the first and second water layers close to the TiS2 surface, and more pronounced when spontaneous dissociative adsorption of water occurs. The extent of water dissociation on each surface was evaluated using enhanced sampling. Zigzag-L is the only interface where proton transfer from adsorbed water to TiS2 surface S atoms is thermodynamically and kinetically favored. The coexistence of surface four-fold-coordinated Ti (Ti4c) and one-fold-coordinated S (S1c) is found to be essential to making proton transfer feasible on the Zigzag-L surface. Furthermore, remaining unprotonated S1c atoms can act as good proton acceptors after water dissociation. Thus, TiS2 with Zigzag-L termination may be a surface to avoid in CDI device construction, given that pH fluctuations adversely affect performance. This work provides new understanding of TiS2/H2O interfacial features that could aid future design and optimization of TiS2-based CDI devices for water desalination.},

We begin by disputing a recent suggestion that nuclear quantum effects may lead to a broadening of polariton bands, finding instead that they merely result in anharmonic red shifts in the polariton frequencies. We go on to show that our simulated cavity spectra can be reproduced to graphical accuracy with a harmonic model that uses just the cavity-free spectrum and the geometry of the cavity as input. We end by showing that this harmonic model can be combined with the experimental cavity-free spectrum to give results in good agreement with optical cavity measurements. Since the input to our harmonic model is equivalent to the input to the transfer matrix method of applied optics, we conclude that cavity molecular dynamics cannot provide any more insight into the effect of vibrational strong coupling on the absorption spectrum than this transfer matrix method, which is already widely used by experimentalists to corroborate their cavity results.},

To date, generative models with reinforcement learning approaches have frequently used low-cost methods to evaluate the quality of the generated molecules, enabling many loops through the generative model. However, for functional molecular materials tasks, such low-cost methods are either not available or would require the generation of large amounts of training data to train surrogate machine learning models. In this work, we develop a framework that connects the REINVENT reinforcement learning framework with excited state quantum chemistry calculations to discover molecules with specified molecular excited state energy levels, specifically molecules with excited state landscapes that would serve as promising singlet fission or triplet--triplet annihilation materials. We employ a two-step curriculum strategy to first find a set of diverse promising molecules, then demonstrate the framework's ability to exploit a more focused chemical space with anthracene derivatives. Under this protocol, we show that the framework can find desired molecules and improve Pareto fronts for targeted properties versus synthesizability. Moreover, we are able to find several different design principles used by chemists for the design of singlet fission and triplet--triplet annihilation molecules.},

We recently showed that the exciton model could be used to coarse-grain electronic structure in multichromophoric systems, focusing on singly excited exciton states [Acc. Chem. Res. 2014, 47, 2857-2866]. However, our previous implementation excluded charge-transfer excited states, which can play an important role in light-harvesting systems and near-infrared optoelectronic materials. Recent studies have also emphasized the significance of charge-transfer in singlet fission, which mediates the coupling between the locally excited states and the multiexcitonic states. In this work, we report on an ab initio exciton model that incorporates charge-transfer excited states and demonstrate that the model provides correct charge-transfer excitation energies and asymptotic behavior. Comparison with TDDFT and EOM-CC2 calculations shows that our exciton model is robust with respect to system size, screening parameter, and different density functionals. Inclusion of charge-transfer excited states makes the exciton model more useful for studies of singly excited states and provides a starting point for future construction of a model that also includes double-exciton states.},

Nuclear tunneling effects enable molecules to overcome the barriers which cannot be overcome classically. Under low-temperature conditions, intrinsic quantum tunneling effects can facilitate the chemical reaction in a pathway that is favored neither thermodynamically nor kinetically. This behavior is referred to as the tunneling-controlled chemical reaction and is regarded as the third paradigm of chemical reaction controls. In this work, we use the ab initio RPMD approach to incorporate the tunneling effects in our quantum dynamics simulations and investigate the reaction kinetics of two competitive reaction pathways at various temperatures. The reaction rate constants obtained here agree extremely well with the experimentally measured rates. We demonstrate the feasibility of using ab initio RPMD rate calculations in a realistic molecular system and provide an interesting and important example for future investigations of reaction mechanisms dominated by quantum tunneling effects.},

Then we develop a finite element time-domain method for solving this model. Numerical stability similar to the continuous stability is proved for our scheme, and the optimal error estimate in the L2 norm is obtained.

  abstract = {Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a prototype molecular system and a sister molecule of water (H2O). The phase diagram of solid H2S at high pressures remains largely unexplored arising from the challenges in dealing with the pressure-induced weakening of S--H bond and larger atomic core difference between H and S. Metallization is yet achieved for H2O, but it was observed for H2S above 96 GPa. However, the metallic structure of H2S remains elusive, greatly impeding the understanding of its metallicity and the potential superconductivity. We have performed an extensive structural study on solid H2S at pressure ranges of 10--200 GPa through an unbiased structure prediction method based on particle swarm optimization algorithm. Besides the findings of candidate structures for nonmetallic phases IV and V, we are able to establish stable metallic structures violating an earlier proposal of elemental decomposition into sulfur and hydrogen [R. Rousseau, M. Boero, M. Bernasconi, M. Parrinello, and K. Terakura, Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 1254 (2000)]. Our study unravels a superconductive potential of metallic H2S with an estimated maximal transition temperature of {$\sim$}80 K at 160 GPa, higher than those predicted for most archetypal hydrogen-containing compounds (e.g., SiH4, GeH4, etc.).},

Based on the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP), the multiconfigurational Ehrenfest (MCE) method has also been developed and can be regarded as a multiconfigurational extension of the traditional Ehrenfest dynamics. However, it is not straightforward to apply the TDVP to surface hopping trajectories because there exists momentum jump during surface hops. To solve this problem, we here propose a multiconfigurational surface hopping (MCSH) method, where continuous momenta are obtained by linear interpolation and the interpolated trajectories are used to construct the basis functions for TDVP in a postprocessing manner. As demonstrated in a series of representative spin-boson models, MCSH achieves high accuracy with only several hundred trajectory bases and can uniformly improve the performance of surface hopping. In principle, MCSH can be combined with all kinds of mixed quantum-classical trajectories and thus has the potential to properly describe general nonadiabatic dynamics.},

  abstract = {Recent experiments suggest that ground state chemical reactivity can be modified when placing molecular systems inside infrared cavities where molecular vibrations are strongly coupled to electromagnetic radiation. This phenomenon lacks a firm theoretical explanation. Here, we employ an exact quantum dynamics approach to investigate a model of cavity-modified chemical reactions in the condensed phase. The model contains the coupling of the reaction coordinate to a generic solvent, cavity coupling to either the reaction coordinate or a non-reactive mode, and the coupling of the cavity to lossy modes. Thus, many of the most important features needed for realistic modeling of the cavity modification of chemical reactions are included. We find that when a molecule is coupled to an optical cavity it is essential to treat the problem quantum mechanically to obtain a quantitative account of alterations to reactivity. We find sizable and sharp changes in the rate constant that are associated with quantum mechanical state splittings and resonances. The features that emerge from our simulations are closer to those observed in experiments than are previous calculations, even for realistically small values of coupling and cavity loss. This work highlights the importance of a fully quantum treatment of vibrational polariton chemistry.},

The meta-surface-hopping method is applied to the problem of estimating nonradiative relaxation rates of a photoexcited iminium ion, CH2NH2+, and evidence for internal consistency of the combined dynamics/perturbation theory approach is presented.},

To efficiently model chemical dynamics under VSC in the collective regime, herein a hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) cavity molecular dynamics (CavMD) scheme is developed and applied to an experimentally studied chemical system. This approach can achieve linear scaling with respect to the number of molecules for a dilute solution under VSC by assuming that each QM solute molecule is surrounded by an independent MM solvent bath. Application of this approach to a dilute solution of Fe(CO)5 in n-dodecane under VSC demonstrates polariton dephasing to the dark modes and polariton-enhanced molecular nonlinear absorption. These simulations predict that strongly exciting the lower polariton may provide an energy transfer pathway that selectively excites the equatorial CO vibrations rather than the axial CO vibrations. Moreover, these simulations also directly probe the cavity effect on the dynamics of the Fe(CO)5 Berry pseudorotation reaction for comparison to recent two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy experiments. This theoretical approach is applicable to a wide range of other polaritonic systems and provides a tool for exploring the use of VSC for selective infrared photochemistry.},

We also present the implementation of several new features, including an efficient algorithm to model bosonic and fermionic exchange, a framework for uncertainty quantification to be used in conjunction with machine-learning potentials, a communication infrastructure that allows for deeper integration with electronic-driven simulations, and an approach to simulate coupled photon-nuclear dynamics in optical or plasmonic cavities.},

  abstract = {Singlet fission (SF), the conversion of one singlet exciton into two triplet excitons, could significantly enhance solar cell efficiency. Molecular crystals that undergo SF are scarce. Computational exploration may accelerate the discovery of SF materials. However, many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) calculations of the excitonic properties of molecular crystals are impractical for large-scale materials screening. We use the sure-independence-screening-and-sparsifying-operator (SISSO) machine-learning algorithm to generate computationally efficient models that can predict the MBPT thermodynamic driving force for SF for a dataset of 101 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH101). SISSO generates models by iteratively combining physical primary features. The best models are selected by linear regression with cross-validation. The SISSO models successfully predict the SF driving force with errors below 0.2\,eV. Based on the cost, accuracy, and classification performance of SISSO models, we propose a hierarchical materials screening workflow. Three potential SF candidates are found in the PAH101 set.},

Here, we study the spin-boson model as a prototype. By utilizing the Majorana-fermion representation together with the polaron transformation, we establish a theoretical approach to analyze Green's functions of the spin-boson model. In contrast to conventional perturbation theories either in the tunneling energy or in the system-bath coupling strength, the proposed scheme gives reliable results over wide regimes of the coupling strength, bias, as well as temperature. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, we consider the susceptibility as well as the symmetrized spin correlation function (SSCF) which can be expressed in terms of Green's functions. Thorough investigations are made on systems embedded in Ohmic or sub-Ohmic bosonic baths. We found the so-obtained SSCF is the same as that of the non-interacting blip approximation (NIBA) in unbiased systems while it is applicable for a wider range of temperature in the biased systems compared with the NIBA. We also show that a previous perturbation result is recovered as a weak coupling limit of the so-obtained SSCF. Furthermore, by studying the quantum criticality of the susceptibility, we confirm the validity of the quantum-to-classical mapping in the whole sub-Ohmic regime.},

We demonstrate that NQEs have a strong effect on HOIP geometry and electron--vibrational dynamics at both low and ambient temperatures, even though charges in HOIPs reside on heavy elements. By combining ring-polymer molecular dynamics (MD) and ab initio MD with nonadiabatic MD and time-dependent density functional theory and focusing on the most studied tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3, we show that NQEs increase the disorder and thermal fluctuations through coupling of the light inorganic cations to the heavy inorganic lattice. The additional disorder induces charge localization and decreases electron--hole interactions. As a result, the nonradiative carrier lifetimes are extended by a factor of 3 at 160 K and 1/3 at 330 K. The radiative lifetimes are increased by 40\% at both temperatures. The fundamental band gap decreases by 0.10 and 0.03 eV at 160 and 330 K, respectively. By enhancing atomic motions and introducing new vibrational modes, NQEs strengthen electron--vibrational interactions. Decoherence, determined by elastic scattering, accelerates almost by a factor of 2 due to NQEs. However, the nonadiabatic coupling, driving nonradiative electron--hole recombination, decreases because it is more sensitive to structural distortions than atomic motions in HOIPs. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that NQEs should be considered to achieve an accurate understanding of geometry evolution and charge carrier dynamics in HOIPs and provides important fundamental insights for the design of HOIPs and related materials for optoelectronic applications.},

Employing two-dimensional circular dichroism (2DCD) spectroscopy, we investigate the transient chiral dynamics of excitons during energy transfer processes within the FMO complex. Our approach, incorporating pulse information into population dynamics based on the third-order response function, facilitates the calculation of 2DCD spectra and dynamics. This enables the extraction of chiral contributions to excitonic energy transfer and the examination of electronic wave functions. We demonstrate that 2DCD spectra offer excitation energies that are better resolved than those from conventional two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. These findings deepen our understanding of exciton energy transfer mechanisms in natural photosynthesis, emphasizing the potential of 2DCD spectroscopy as a powerful tool for unraveling the chiral contribution to exciton dynamics.},

Unlike several prior theoretical studies treating the monomers as simple two-level systems, exciton-vibration coupling is explicitly included in the description of open quantum dynamics of the system. In the framework of the Holstein-Tavis-Cummings model with truncated vibrational space, we investigate the steady-state exciton transfer through both a molecular dimer and longer molecular chains. For a molecular dimer, we find that vibration-assisted exciton transfer occurs at strong exciton-cavity coupling regime where the vacuum Rabi splitting matches the frequency of a single vibrational quantum, whereas for longer molecular chains, vibration-assisted transfer is found to occur at the ultrastrong exciton-cavity coupling limit. In addition, finite relaxation of vibrational modes induced by the continuous phonon bath is found to further facilitate the exciton transport in vibrational enhancement regimes.},

The coupling of transition densities yields the F{\"o}rster type excitation energy transfer coupling, and from the charge density coupling, a shift in molecular excitation energies results. Starting from an ab initio calculation of the charge and transition densities, atomic partial charges are determined such as to fit the resulting electrostatic potentials of the different states and the transition. The different intermolecular couplings are then obtained from the Coulomb couplings between the respective atomic partial charges. The excitation energy transfer couplings obtained in the present TrEsp (transition charge from electrostatic potential) method are compared with couplings obtained from the simple point-dipole and extended dipole approximations and with those from the ab initio transition},

Such dissipative processes are captured by the paradigmatic spin-boson model, describing a two-state particle, the ``spin'', interacting with an environment formed by harmonic oscillators. A fundamental question to date is to what extent intense coherent driving impacts a strongly dissipative system. Here we investigate experimentally and theoretically a superconducting qubit strongly coupled to an electromagnetic environment and subjected to a coherent drive. This setup realizes the driven Ohmic spin-boson model. We show that the drive reinforces environmental suppression of quantum coherence, and that a coherent-to-incoherent transition can be achieved by tuning the drive amplitude. An out-of-equilibrium detailed balance relation is demonstrated. These results advance fundamental understanding of open quantum systems and bear potential for the design of entangled light-matter states.},

Specifically, we successfully obtain energies, entanglement entropies, and orientational correlations that are in agreement with the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG), which has been previously used for this system. We find that the entropies calculated by ML-MCTDH for larger system sizes contain nonmonotonicity, as expected in the vicinity of a second-order quantum phase transition between ordered and disordered rotor states. We observe that this effect remains when all couplings besides nearest-neighbor are omitted from the Hamiltonian, which suggests that it is not sensitive to the rate of decay of the interactions. In contrast to DMRG, which is tailored to the one-dimensional case, ML-MCTDH (as implemented in the Heidelberg MCTDH package) requires more computational time and memory, although the requirements are still within reach of commodity hardware. The numerical convergence and computational demand of two practical implementations of ML-MCTDH and DMRG are presented in detail for various combinations of system parameters.},

Here I review the fundamental challenges the approximate functionals have in describing double excitations and charge-transfer excitations, which are two of the most common impediments for the theory to be applied in a black-box way. At the same time, I describe the progress made in recent decades in developing functional approximations that give useful predictions for these excitations.},

They contain fucoxanthin and chlorophyll-a/c binding proteins (FCPs) as light-harvesting complexes with a remarkable adaptation to the fluctuating light on ocean surfaces. To understand the basis of the photosynthetic process in diatoms, the excitation energy funneling within FCPs must be probed. A state-of-the-art multiscale analysis within a quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics framework has been employed. To this end, the chlorophyll (Chl) excitation energies within the FCP complex from the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum have been determined. The Chl-c excitation energies were found to be 5-fold more susceptible to electric fields than those of Chl-a pigments and thus are significantly lower in FCP than in organic solvents. This finding challenges the general belief that the excitation energy of Chl-c is always higher than that of Chl-a in FCP proteins and reveals that Chl-c molecules are much more sensitive to electric fields within protein scaffolds than in Chl-a pigments. The analysis of the linear absorption spectrum and the two-dimensional electronic spectra of the FCP complex strongly supports these findings and allows us to study the excitation transfer within the FCP complex.},

The recently developed multiscale approach based on the numerically efficient density functional tight-binding framework followed by excited state calculations has been shown to be superior to the scheme based on pure classical molecular dynamics simulations. The enhanced approach, which improves the description of the internal vibrational dynamics of the pigment molecules, yields spectral densities in good agreement with the experimental counterparts for various bacterial and plant LH systems.

This exact decomposition reduces the number of terms by a factor that increases exponentially with propagation time. Further, under conditions (moderately high temperature and/or dissipation strength) that lead primarily to incoherent dynamics, the ``fully incoherent limit'' zero-blip term of the series provides a reasonable approximation to the dynamics, and the blip series converges rapidly to the exact result. Retention of only the blips required for satisfactory convergence leads to speedup of full-memory path integral calculations by many orders of magnitude.},

The QCPI methodology incorporates all effects associated with stimulated phonon absorption and emission as its crudest limit, thus can (in some regimes) converge faster than influence functional-based path integral methods specifically designed for system--bath Hamiltonians. It is shown that the QCPI phase arising from a harmonic bath can be summed analytically with respect to the discrete bath degrees of freedom and expressed in terms of precomputed influence functional coefficients, avoiding the explicit enumeration of forced oscillator trajectories, whose number grows exponentially with the length of quantum memory. Further, adoption of the blip decomposition (which classifies the system paths based on the time length over which their forward and backward components are not identical) and a cumulative treatment of the QCPI phase between blips allows elimination of the majority of system paths, leading to a dramatic increase in efficiency. The generalization of these acceleration techniques to anharmonic environments is discussed.},

The starting point is the expression of the reduced density matrix for a quantum system interacting with a harmonic dissipative bath in the form of a forward-backward path sum, where the effects of the bath enter through the Feynman-Vernon influence functional. The path sum is evaluated iteratively in time by propagating an array that stores blip configurations within the memory interval. Convergence with respect to the number of blips and the memory length yields numerically exact results which are free of statistical error. In situations of strongly dissipative, sluggish baths, the algorithm leads to a dramatic reduction of computational effort in comparison with iterative path integral methods that do not implement the blip decomposition. This gain in efficiency arises from (i) the rapid convergence of the blip series and (ii) circumventing the explicit enumeration of between-blip path segments, whose number grows exponentially with the memory length. Application to an asymmetric dissipative two-level system illustrates the rapid convergence of the algorithm even when the bath memory is extremely long.},

Its high efficiency lies in the small size of the SMatPI matrices employed in the iterative algorithm, whose size is equal to that of the full RDM. By avoiding the storage and multiplication of large tensors, the SMatPI algorithm is applicable in multistate systems under a variety of conditions. The main computational effort is the evaluation of path sums within the entangled memory length to construct the SMatPI matrices. A number of methods are available for this task, each with its own favorable parameter regime, but calculations with strong system-bath coupling and long memory at low temperatures remain out of reach.

Truncation of the expansion at the quadratic terms allows mapping of a many-body environment onto an effective harmonic model with the same force autocorrelation function, recovering the conventional linear response limit. It is shown that the latter becomes exact in the thermodynamic limit if the bath consists of independent modes coupled to the system via coefficients that scale appropriately with the size of the bath. Low-order correction terms to the linear response approximation are found to be given by multitime correlation functions of the force exerted by the bath on the system. Within a classical approximation, such correction terms can be obtained from molecular dynamics calculations and incorporated in the path integral, which can be evaluated by means of iterative procedures. Numerical calculations on an intrinsically nonlinear bath of two-level systems confirm the above behaviors and indicate that the deviations from the linear response approximation are more significant at low temperatures where quantum mechanical effects play an important role to the bath dynamics.},

The present paper describes the modular path integral methodology for simulating dynamical properties by propagating the density matrix in real time. The procedure is first presented for the simple topology of a single-file arrangement of units interacting via nearest neighbor couplings and subsequently extended to the calculation of two-particle correlations in arrays that may also contain some long-range interactions, to the treatment of systems with side chains or cyclic structures, to the simulation of internal dynamics in long organic molecules, and to the modifications required for coupling of one or several units of a system to dissipative environments.

In a recent Letter [Chem. Phys. Lett. 221, 482 (1994)], we demonstrated that the range of the nonlocal interactions is finite even at zero temperature, such that the nonlocal kernel extends over only a few time steps if the path integral is expressed in terms of accurate quasiadiabatic propagators. This feature arises from disruption of phase coherence in macroscopic environments and leads to Markovian dynamics for an augmented reduced density tensor, permitting iterative time evolution schemes. In the present paper we analyze the structure and properties of the relevant tensor propagator. Specifically, we show that the tensor multiplication scheme rigorously conserves the trace of the reduced density matrix, and that in cases of short-range nonlocality it leads to Redfield-type equations which are correct to all orders in perturbation theory and which take into account memory effects. We also argue that a simple eigenvector analysis reveals (without actual iteration) the nature of the dynamics and of the equilibrium state, and directly yields quantum reaction or relaxation rates.},

Here, we identify the origin of this discrepancy in the MQC formulation and propose a modification. We analytically show that the modified MQC approach is exact for all correlation functions at time zero, and in a study of zero-point energy (ZPE) flow, we numerically demonstrate that it correctly obtains the quantum and classical limits as a function of time. Interestingly, although classical-limit MQC simulations show the expected, unphysical ZPE leakage, we find that it is possible to predict and even modify the direction of ZPE flow through selective quantization of the system, with the quantum-limit modes accepting energy but preserving the minimum quantum mechanically required energy.},

  abstract = {The Wigner phase space formulation of quantum mechanics is a complete framework for quantum dynamic calculations that elegantly highlights connections with classical dynamics. In this series of two articles, building upon previous efforts, we derive the full hierarchy of approximate semiclassical (SC) dynamic methods for adiabatic and non-adiabatic problems in Wigner phase space. In Paper I, focusing on adiabatic single surface processes, we derive the well-known double Herman--Kluk (DHK) approximation for real-time correlation functions in Wigner phase space and connect it to the linearized SC (LSC) approximation through a stationary phase approximation. We exploit this relationship to introduce a new hybrid SC method, termed Adiabatic Hybrid Wigner Dynamics (AHWD) that allows for a few important ``system'' degrees of freedom (dofs) to be treated at the DHK level, while treating the rest of the dofs (the ``bath'') at the LSC level. AHWD is shown to accurately capture quantum interference effects in models of coupled oscillators and the decoherence of vibrational probability density of a model I2 Morse oscillator coupled to an Ohmic thermal bath. We show that AHWD significantly mitigates the sign~problem and employs reduced dimensional prefactors bringing calculations of complex system--bath problems within the reach of SC methods. Paper II focuses on extending this hybrid SC dynamics to nonadiabatic processes.},

In this second article, we extend our hybrid Wigner dynamics to nonadiabatic processes. The resulting Nonadiabatic Hybrid Wigner Dynamics (NHWD) has two variants that differ in the choice of degrees of freedom to be quantized. Specifically, we introduce NHWD(E) where only the electronic state variables are quantized and the NHWD(V) where both electronic state variables and a handful of strongly coupled nuclear modes are quantized. We show that while NHWD(E) proves accurate for a wide range of scattering models and spin-boson models, systems where a few nuclear modes are strongly coupled to electronic states require NHWD(V) to accurately capture the long-time dynamics. Taken together, we show that AHWD and NHWD represent a new framework for SC simulations of high-dimensional systems with significant quantum effects.},

In practical studies of high-dimensional reactions, neither extreme is the best choice: frequently a high-level quantum mechanical description is only required for a handful of modes, while the majority of environment modes that do not play a key role in the reactive event of interest are well served with a lower level of theory. In this feature, we introduce modified Filinov filtration as a powerful tool to construct mixed quantum-classical SC theories where different subsystems can be quantized to different extents without introducing ad hoc intersubsystem interaction terms. We demonstrate that these Filinov-based SC methods can systematically tune between quantum and classical limit SC behavior, offering a practical way forward to accurate and computationally efficient simulations of high-dimensional quantum processes.},

  abstract = {When molecules are coupled to an optical cavity, new light--matter hybrid states, so-called polaritons, are formed due to quantum light--matter interactions. With the experimental demonstrations of modifying chemical reactivities by forming polaritons under strong light--matter interactions, theorists have been encouraged to develop new methods to simulate these systems and discover new strategies to tune and control reactions. This review summarizes some of these exciting theoretical advances in polariton chemistry, in methods ranging from the fundamental framework to computational techniques and applications spanning from photochemistry to vibrational strong coupling. Even though the theory of quantum light--matter interactions goes back to the midtwentieth century, the gaps in the knowledge of molecular quantum electrodynamics (QED) have only recently been filled. We review recent advances made in resolving gauge ambiguities, the correct form of different QED Hamiltonians under different gauges, and their connections to various quantum optics models. Then, we review recently developed ab initio QED approaches which can accurately describe polariton states in a realistic molecule--cavity hybrid system. We then discuss applications using these method advancements. We review advancements in polariton photochemistry where the cavity is made resonant to electronic transitions to control molecular nonadiabatic excited state dynamics and enable new photochemical reactivities. When the cavity resonance is tuned to the molecular vibrations instead, ground-state chemical reaction modifications have been demonstrated experimentally, though its mechanistic principle remains unclear. We present some recent theoretical progress in resolving this mystery. Finally, we review the recent advances in understanding the collective coupling regime between light and matter, where many molecules can collectively couple to a single cavity mode or many cavity modes. We also lay out the current challenges in theory to explain the observed experimental results. We hope that this review will serve as a useful document for anyone who wants to become familiar with the context of polariton chemistry and molecular cavity QED and thus significantly benefit the entire community.},

Combined experimental-computational studies have revealed that such broad absorption profiles of these proteins arise from photoexcited charge transfer (CT) transitions in spatially proximal charged amino acids such as lysine (Lys) and glutamate (Glu). Here, using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) with an optimally tuned CAM-B3LYP functional, we refine the computed UV--vis spectra for Lys-Glu dimers within protein folds and quantify the percentage CT character of the constituent transitions. The optimally tuned functionals are derived through a careful analysis of the CAM-B3LYP parameter space for Lys-Glu dimers as a function of amino-acid conformation and side chain separation. Our studies reveal that the tuned Lys-Glu dimer spectrum spans 150--650 nm and possesses 5 specific types of CT excitations with diverse and large spatial charge separation length scales of 2--10 {\AA}. These include inter-/intra-residue peptide backbone to peptide backbone (BB-CT) excitations spanning 160--210 nm, inter-/intra-residue peptide backbone to side chain (BS-CT) excitations spanning 160--260 nm, and side chain to side chain (SS-CT) excitations, which show the broadest absorption range spanning 260--650 nm.},

These equations are a great standard in non-perturbative non-Markovian open quantum systems. They are exact for harmonic baths in the limit of relevant truncation of the hierarchy. We recall the link with the perturbative second-order time convolution equations also known as the Bloch--Redfield equations. Some theoretical tools characterizing non-Markovian dynamics such as the non-Markovianity measures or the dynamical map are also briefly discussed in the context of HEOM simulations. The main points of the tensor-train expansion are illustrated in an example with a qubit interacting with a bath described by a Lorentzian spectral density. Finally, we give three illustrative applications in which the system--bath coupling operator is similar to that of the analytical treatment. The first example revisits a model in which population-to-coherence transfer via the bath creates a long-lasting coherence between two states. The second one is devoted to the computation of stationary absorption and emission spectra. We illustrate the link between the spectral density and the Stokes shift in situations with and without nonadiabatic interaction. Finally, we simulate an excitation transfer when the spectral density is discretized by undamped modes to illustrate a situation in which the TT formulation is more efficient than the standard one.},

Results for anthracene and tetracene are recalled from previous work (Manian et al. in J Chem Phys 155:054108, 2021), and the results for all three polyacenes are juxtaposed to each other. While at the Franck--Condon point, each of the three noted polyacenes were found to possess a quantum yield near unity. Following the consideration of Herzberg--Teller effects, quantum yields stabilised for anthracene and tetracene to 0.19 and 0.08, respectively. Conversely, the second order corrected quantum yield for naphthalene was found to be 0.91. Analysis of this result showed that while the predicted non-radiative pathways correlate well with what should be expected, the approximation used to calculate second order corrected fluorescence, which yielded very positive results for many other molecular systems, here is unable to account for strong second order contributions, resulting in a grossly overestimated rate of fluorescence. However, substitution of an experimental radiative rate results in a quantum yield of 0.33. This work extols the importance of Herzberg--Teller terms in photophysical descriptions of chromophores, and highlights those cases in which a treatment beyond the above approximation is required.},

We report the experimental realization of an isotropic complete photonic band gap (PBG) in a 2D disordered dielectric structure. This structure is designed by a constrained optimization method, which combines advantages of both isotropy due to disorder and controlled scattering properties due to low-density fluctuations (hyperuniformity) and uniform local topology. Our experiments use a modular design composed of Al2O3 walls and cylinders arranged in a hyperuniform disordered network. We observe a complete PBG in the microwave region, in good agreement with theoretical simulations, and show that the intrinsic isotropy of this unique class of PBG materials enables remarkable design freedom, including the realization of waveguides with arbitrary bending angles impossible in photonic crystals. This experimental verification of a complete PBG and realization of functional defects in this unique class of materials demonstrate their potential as building blocks for precise manipulation of photons in planar optical microcircuits and has implications for disordered acoustic and electronic band gap materials.},

This mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH) propagates the nuclei on the active adiabatic potential-energy surface, such as in FSSH. However, unlike in FSSH, transitions between active surfaces are deterministic and occur when the electronic mapping variables evolve between specified regions of the electronic phase space. This guarantees internal consistency between the active surface and the electronic degrees of freedom throughout the dynamics. MASH is rigorously derivable from exact quantum mechanics as a limit of the quantum--classical Liouville equation (QCLE), leading to a unique prescription for momentum rescaling and frustrated hops. Hence, a quantum-jump procedure can, in principle, be used to systematically converge the accuracy of the results to that of the QCLE. This jump procedure also provides a rigorous framework for deriving approximate decoherence corrections similar to those proposed for FSSH. We apply MASH to simulate the nonadiabatic dynamics in various model systems and show that it consistently produces more accurate results than FSSH at a comparable computational cost.},

For our simulations, we choose a numerically unbiased representation of the molecule's wave function, enabling us to compare with experiments, exhibiting good agreement. Having access to the full wave function allows us to study in detail the post-quench dynamics of the excitons. Here, one of our main findings is the identification of a time scale t0 {$\approx$} 35~fs dominated by coherent dynamics. It is within this time scale that the larger fraction of the singlet fission yield is generated. We also report on a reduced number of phononic modes that play a crucial role in the energy transfer between excitonic and vibrational systems. Notably, the oscillation frequency of these modes coincides with the observed electronic coherence time t0. We extend our investigations by also studying the dependency of the dynamics on the excitonic energy levels that, for instance, can be experimentally tuned by means of the solvent polarity. Here, our findings indicate that the singlet fission yield can be doubled, while the electronic coherence time t0 is mainly unaffected.},

  abstract = {A 10-parameter, range-separated hybrid (RSH), generalized gradient approximation (GGA) density functional with nonlocal correlation (VV10) is presented. Instead of truncating the B97-type power series inhomogeneity correction factors (ICF) for the exchange, same-spin correlation, and opposite-spin correlation functionals uniformly, all 16\,383 combinations of the linear parameters up to fourth order (m = 4) are considered. These functionals are individually fit to a training set and the resulting parameters are validated on a primary test set in order to identify the 3 optimal ICF expansions. Through this procedure, it is discovered that the functional that performs best on the training and primary test sets has 7 linear parameters, with 3 additional nonlinear parameters from range-separation and nonlocal correlation. The resulting density functional, {$\omega$}B97X-V, is further assessed on a secondary test set, the parallel-displaced coronene dimer, as well as several geometry datasets. Furthermore, the basis set dependence and integration grid sensitivity of {$\omega$}B97X-V are analyzed and documented in order to facilitate the use of the functional.},

  abstract = {In the past 30 years, Kohn?Sham density functional theory has emerged as the most popular electronic structure method in computational chemistry. To assess the ever-increasing number of approximate exchange-correlation functionals, this review benchmarks a total of 200 density functionals on a molecular database (MGCDB84) of nearly 5000 data points. The database employed, provided as Supplemental Data, is comprised of 84 data-sets and contains non-covalent interactions, isomerisation energies, thermochemistry, and barrier heights. In addition, the evolution of non-empirical and semi-empirical density functional design is reviewed, and guidelines are provided for the proper and effective use of density functionals. The most promising functional considered is ?B97M-V, a range-separated hybrid meta-GGA with VV10 nonlocal correlation, designed using a combinatorial approach. From the local GGAs, B97-D3, revPBE-D3, and BLYP-D3 are recommended, while from the local meta-GGAs, B97M-rV is the leading choice, followed by MS1-D3 and M06-L-D3. The best hybrid GGAs are ?B97X-V, ?B97X-D3, and ?B97X-D, while useful hybrid meta-GGAs (besides ?B97M-V) include ?M05-D, M06-2X-D3, and MN15. Ultimately, today's state-of-the-art functionals are close to achieving the level of accuracy desired for a broad range of chemical applications, and the principal remaining limitations are associated with systems that exhibit significant self-interaction/delocalisation errors and/or strong correlation effects.},

By restricting the open quantum system to a single excitation, typical of experimental realizations in quantum optics, we analytically solve the TC model with an arbitrary number of atoms with linear complexity. This solution allows us to devise the Quantum Mapping Algorithm of Resonator Interaction with N Atoms (Q-MARINA), an intuitive TC mapping to a quantum circuit with linear space and time scaling, whose N+1 qubits represent atoms and a lossy cavity, while the dynamics is encoded through 2N entangling gates. Finally, we benchmark the robustness of the algorithm on a quantum simulator and superconducting quantum processors against the quantum master equation solution on a classical computer.},

We illustrate the approach on the simple but unforgiving problem of quantum evolution of a two-state quantum system in the limit of unperturbed pure state dynamics and for dissipative evolution in the presence of both stationary and nonstationary random environments. We formulate our approach in the Liouville representation and describe the density matrix elements by ensembles of trajectories. Population dynamics are represented by stochastic surface hops for trajectories representing diagonal density matrix elements. These are combined with an unconventional coherent stochastic hopping algorithm for trajectories representing off-diagonal quantum coherences. The latter generalizes the binary (0,1) ``probability'' of a trajectory to be associated with a given state to allow integers that can be negative or greater than unity in magnitude. Unlike existing surface hopping methods, the dynamics of the ensembles are fully entangled, correctly capturing the coherent and nonlocal structure of quantum mechanics.},

  abstract = {We describe a new method for simulating nonadiabatic dynamics using stochastic trajectories. The method, which we call quantum trajectory surface hopping (QTSH), is a variant of the popular fewest-switches surface-hopping (FSSH) approach, but with important differences. We briefly review and significantly extend our recently described consensus surface-hopping (CSH) formalism, which captures quantum effects such as coherence and decoherence via a collective representation of the quantum dynamics at the ensemble level. Using well-controlled further approximations, we derive an independent trajectory limit of CSH that recovers the FSSH stochastic algorithm but rejects the ad hoc momentum rescaling of FSSH in favor of quantum forces that couple classical and quantum degrees of freedom and lead to nonclassical trajectory dynamics. The approach is well-defined in both the diabatic and adiabatic representations. In the adiabatic representation, the classical dynamics are modified by a quantum-state-dependent vector potential, introducing geometric phase effects into the dynamics of multidimensional systems. Unlike FSSH, our method obeys energy conservation without any artificial momentum rescaling, eliminating undesirable features of the former such as forbidden hops and breakdown of the internal consistency of quantum and ensemble-based state probabilities. Corrections emerge naturally in the formalism that allow approximate incorporation of decoherence without the computational expense of the full CSH approach. The method is tested on several model systems. QTSH provides a surface-hopping methodology that has a rigorous foundation and broader applicability than FSSH while retaining the low computational cost of an independent trajectory framework.},

As a result, we demonstrate the high efficacy of such tools in classifying noisy quantum dynamics using simulated data sets from different realizations of the quantum system dynamics. In addition, we show that for a successful classification one just needs to measure, in a sequence of discrete time instants, the probabilities that the analysed quantum system is in one of the allowed positions or energy configurations. Albeit the training of machine learning models is here performed on synthetic data, our approach is expected to find application in experimental schemes, as e.g. for the noise benchmarking of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.},

The discussion begins from a wave function formulation of the problem, and this enables one to retain interference effects if these are important, but the ultimate objective is to obtain as classical-like a description as possible while taking account of the inter-electronic state coupling. The essential approximation in the method is in the computation of these coupling terms which appear as nonclassical corrections to the classical equations of motion. The computational results are tested against accurate quantal computations, and the agreement is typically quantitative.},

The implicit solvation model follows the framework of joint density functional theory. We describe the framework, our algorithm and implementation, and benchmarks for small molecular systems. We apply the solvation model to study the surface energies of different facets of semiconducting and metallic nanocrystals and the SN2 reaction pathway. We find that solvation reduces the surface energies of the nanocrystals, especially for the semiconducting ones and increases the energy barrier of the SN2 reaction.},

In the present work, we demonstrate a TDDFT-based rapid and cost-effective computational approach for designing SF chromophores by doping various atomic sites (substituting carbon atoms) of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with nitrogen, phosphorus, and silicon. We establish a hitherto unexplored, direct correlation between the atom-specific chemical reactivity parameter-Fukui function-of these molecules with their frontier molecular orbital energies, diradical characters, and vertical singlet and triplet excitation energies. These quantitative correlations show exactly opposite trends for nitrogen-doped molecules and phosphorus- or silicon-doped molecules. The doped derivatives that have the Fukui function falling in a range of 0.03--0.14 possess the required intermediate diradical character and suitable singlet--triplet energies to qualify for SF candidature. Our findings enable one, at reasonable computational times and cost, to easily assess the doping criteria and to develop design rules for SF molecules in particular and for diradicaloids in general.},

To bridge this gap, we have developed a novel method for cavity QED calculations utilizing the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm in conjunction with the Pauli--Fierz Hamiltonian. Our approach is applied to investigate the effect of the cavity on the S0--S1 transition of n-oligoacenes, with n ranging from 2 to 5, encompassing 22 fully correlated {$\pi$} orbitals in the largest pentacene molecule. Our findings indicate that the influence of the cavity intensifies with larger acenes. Additionally, we demonstrate that, unlike the full determinantal representation, DMRG efficiently optimizes and eliminates excess photonic degrees of freedom, resulting in an asymptotically constant computational cost as the photonic basis increases.},

  abstract = {When simulating nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, choosing an electronic representation requires consideration of well-known trade-offs. The uniqueness and spatially local couplings of the adiabatic representation come at the expense of an electronic wave function that changes discontinuously with nuclear motion and associated singularities in the nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements. The quasi-diabatic representation offers a smoothly varying wave function and finite couplings, but identification of a globally well-behaved quasi-diabatic representation is a system-specific challenge. In this work, we introduce the diabatized Gaussians on adiabatic surfaces (DGAS) approximation, a variant of the ab initio multiple spawning (AIMS) method that preserves the advantages of both electronic representations while avoiding their respective pitfalls. The DGAS wave function is expanded in a basis of vibronic functions that are continuous in both electronic and nuclear coordinates, but potentially discontinuous in time. Because the time-dependent Schr{\"o}dinger equation contains only first-order derivatives with respect to time, singularities in the second-derivative nonadiabatic coupling terms (i.e., diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction; DBOC) at conical intersections are rigorously absent, though singular time-derivative couplings remain. Interpolation of the electronic wave function allows the accurate prediction of population transfer probabilities even in the presence of the remaining singularities. We compare DGAS calculations of the dynamics of photoexcited ethene to AIMS calculations performed in the adiabatic representation, including the DBOC. The 28 fs excited state lifetime observed in DGAS simulations is considerably shorter than the 50 fs lifetime observed in the adiabatic simulations. The slower decay in the adiabatic representation is attributable to the large, repulsive DBOC in the neighborhood of conical intersections. These repulsive DBOC terms are artifacts of the discontinuities in the individual adiabatic vibronic basis functions and therefore cannot reflect the behavior of the exact molecular wave function, which must be continuous.},

Machine learning algorithms have the potential to reduce the number of these computations significantly.

It comes with powerful Plugin and Workflow engines, which allows intuitive customization for individual tasks. Data is automatically stored through the database framework, which enables additional interpolation of properties in previously evaluated regions of the conformational space. To illustrate the potential of the framework, a code for nonadiabatic surface hopping simulations based on the Landau--Zener algorithm is presented here. Deriving gradients from the interpolated potential energy surfaces allows for full-dimensional nonadiabatic surface hopping simulations using only adiabatic energies (energy only). Simulations of a pyrazine model and ab initio-based calculations of the SO2 molecule show that energy-only calculations with PySurf are able to correctly predict the nonadiabatic dynamics of these prototype systems. The results reveal the degree of sophistication, which can be achieved by the database accelerated energy-only surface hopping simulations being competitive to commonly used semiclassical approaches.},

Recent extensions of MCTDH are treated in brief, namely, MCTDHB and MCTDHF, for treating identical particles (bosons and fermions), and the very powerful multilayer (ML-MCTDH) formalism. Compact representations of potential energy surfaces (PESs) are also discussed, as the representation of a PES becomes a major bottleneck when going to larger systems (nine or more dimensions) while employing a full-dimensional, complicated, and nonseparable PES. As applications of MCTDH, we discuss the calculation of photoionization and photoexcitation spectra of the vibronically coupled systems butatriene and pyrazine, respectively, and the infra-red spectrum of the Zundel cation (protonated water dimer) H5O+2. ? 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

However, a detailed investigation of its approximations and their consequences is currently missing in the literature. In this work, we simulate the explicit photoexcitation and subsequent excited-state dynamics of a simple system, LiH, and we analyze (i) the effect of the ab initio multiple spawning approximations on different observables and (ii) the convergence of the ab initio multiple spawning results towards numerically exact quantum dynamics upon a progressive relaxation of these approximations. We show that, despite the crude character of the approximations underlying ab initio multiple spawning for this low-dimensional system, the qualitative excited-state dynamics is adequately captured, and affordable corrections can further be applied to ameliorate the coupling between trajectory basis functions.},

  abstract = {A classical model for the interaction of molecular systems with infrared radiation is presented. It differs from the usual ''semiclassical theory of radiation and matter'' in that the molecular system is treated by classical rather than quantum mechanics, and the radiation field is described, as in Jaynes' neoclassical theory, as classical (mechanical) harmonic oscillators rather than as a classical field (i.e., via Maxwell's equations). The classical Hamiltonian for the composite system---molecules, radiation, and their interaction---is thus that of a completely mechanical system, and its classical dynamics is determined by computing the classical trajectories of the system. Quantum mechanical interference and tunneling effects can be built into the description within the framework of the classical S-matrix theory. Even within the strictly classical limit of the model, it is shown that all dynamical effects in the interaction of radiation and matter are obtained; in the perturbative limit, for example, it is shown that absorption and induced emission, and even spontaneous emission, which is often difficult to obtain in other classical or semiclassical models, appear in a completely straightforward manner.},

  abstract = {It is noted that the recently developed symmetrical quasi-classical (SQC) treatment of the Meyer-Miller (MM) model for the simulation of electronically non-adiabatic dynamics provides a good description of detailed balance, even though the dynamics which results from the classical MM Hamiltonian is ``Ehrenfest dynamics'' (i.e., the force on the nuclei is an instantaneous coherent average over all electronic states). This is seen to be a consequence of the SQC windowing methodology for ``processing'' the results of the trajectory calculation. For a particularly simple model discussed here, this is shown to be true regardless of the choice of windowing function employed in the SQC model, and for a more realistic full classical molecular dynamics simulation, it is seen to be maintained correctly for very long time.},

Chemical dynamics theory has made great strides in the ensuing decades, so that methods are now available for treating the quantum dynamics of small molecular systems essentially completely. For the large molecular systems that are of so much interest nowadays (e.g., chemical reactions in solution, in clusters, in nanostructures, in biological systems, etc.), however, the only generally available theoretical approach is classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Much effort is currently being devoted to the development of approaches for describing the quantum dynamics of these complex systems. This paper reviews some of these approaches, especially the use of semiclassical approximations for adding quantum effects to classical MD simulations, also showing some new versions that should make these semiclassical approaches even more practical and accurate.},

Since a calculation of the quantum Boltzmann operator is feasible for quite complex molecular systems (by Monte Carlo path integral methods), having an accurate rate theory that involves only the Boltzmann operator could be quite useful. The application of this quantum instanton approximation to several one- and two-dimensional model problems illustrates its potential; e.g., it is able to describe thermal rate constants accurately ({$\sim$}10--20\% error) from high to low temperatures deep in the tunneling regime, and applies equally well to asymmetric and symmetric potentials.},

It is argued that this model should provide an accurate description of the threshold region of the reaction where quantum effects are most significant. Finally, an even more general model, a new kind of semiclassical approximation, is presented which is essentially a synthesis of this quantum mechanical transition state model and the completely classical trajectory procedure for determining the rate constant; at sufficiently high temperatures, quantum effects become negligible, so that the correct rate constant is obtained; while at low temperature, the correct result is obtained because the transition state model becomes valid.},

This paper reviews the background and rebirth of interest in such approaches and surveys a variety of their recent applications. Special focus is on the ability to treat the dynamics of complex systems, and in this regard, the forward-backward (FB) version of the approach is especially promising. Several examples of the FB-IVR applied to model problems of many degrees of freedom show it to be capable of describing quantum effects quite well and also how these effects are quenched when some of the degrees of freedom are averaged over (``decoherence'').},

In this review, we describe the underlying photophysical principles by which this energy is absorbed, as well as the mechanisms of electronic excitation energy transfer (EET). First, optical properties of the individual pigment chromophores present in light-harvesting antenna complexes are introduced, and then we examine the collective behavior of pigment-pigment and pigment-protein interactions. The description of energy transfer, in particular multichromophoric antenna structures, is shown to vary depending on the spatial and energetic landscape, which dictates the relative coupling strength between constituent pigment molecules.

Here we derive a general ligand field theory model to describe and quantify the nature of spin--phonon coupling terms in S = 1/2 transition metal complexes. We show that the coupling term for a given vibrational mode is governed by: (1) the magnitude of the metal-based spin--orbit coupling constant, (2) the magnitude and gradient in the ligand field excited state energy, which determines the magnitude of ground state orbital angular momentum, and (3) dynamic relativistic nephelauxetic contributions reflecting the magnitude and gradient in the covalency of the ligand--metal bonds. From an extensive series of density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations calibrated to a range of experimental data, spin--phonon coupling terms describing minimalistic D4h/D2d [CuCl4]2- and C4v [VOCl4]2- complexes translate to and correlate with experimental quantum coherence properties observed for Cu(ii)- and V(iv)-based molecular qubits with different ligand sets, geometries, and coordination numbers.

However, there have been lingering confusion and debates on the nature of the all-important triplet pair intermediate states and the definition of singlet fission rates. Here we clarify the confusion from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. We distinguish the triplet pair state that maintains electronic coherence between the two constituent triplets, 1(TT), from one which does not, 1(T{$\cdot\cdot\cdot$}T). Only the rate of formation of 1(T{$\cdot\cdot\cdot$}T) is defined as that of singlet fission. We present distinct experimental evidence for 1(TT), whose formation may occur via incoherent and/or vibronic coherent mechanisms. We discuss the challenges in treating singlet fission beyond the dimer approximation, in understanding the often neglected roles of delocalization on singlet fission rates, and in realizing the much lauded goal of increasing solar energy conversion efficiencies with singlet fission chromophores.},

Second it is demonstrated that while the presence of the eighth chromophore does not cause a dramatic change in the energy-transfer efficiency, it does however lead to a dominant energy-transfer pathway that can be characterized by an effective three-site system. Finally, we confirm that the energy-transfer process in the eight-site complex remains efficient and robust through computations of the optimal values of the bath parameters.},

As is well known, the classical dynamics of dissipative  systems may be described in terms of a generalized Langevin equation. The  continuum limit SCIVR uses the Langevin trajectories as input, albeit with a  quantum noise rather than a classical noise. Combining this development with the  forward-backward form of the prefactor-free propagator leads to a tractable  scheme for computing quantum thermal correlation functions. Here we present the  first implementation of this continuum limit SCIVR series method to study two  model problems of vibrational relaxation. Simulations of the dissipative harmonic  oscillator system over a wide range of parameters demonstrate that at most only  the first two terms in the SCIVR series are needed for convergence of the  correlation function. The methodology is then applied to the vibrational  relaxation of a dissipative Morse oscillator. Here, too, the SCIVR series  converges rapidly as the first two terms are sufficient to provide the quantum  mechanical relaxation with an estimated accuracy on the order of a few percent.  The results in this case are compared with computations obtained using the  classical Wigner approximation for the relaxation dynamics.},

This approach is based on the partial linearized density matrix approach to model the exciton dynamics with explicit propagation of the phonon bath environment, combined with a stochastic Lindblad dynamics approach to model the cavity loss dynamics. Through simulating both linear and polariton two-dimensional electronic spectra, we systematically investigate how light--matter coupling strength and cavity loss rate influence the optical response signal. Our results confirm the polaron decoupling effect, which is the reduced exciton--phonon coupling among polariton states due to the strong light--matter interactions. We further demonstrate that the polariton coherence time can be significantly prolonged compared to the electronic coherence outside the cavity.},

The major difference between the absorption line shapes of LH2 and LH3 is the shift of the 850 nm band of the former to a new 820 nm region.

To illustrate the properties of the current approach, we focus on the spin-boson model and limit our attention to the use of a simple and inexpensive quasi-classical dynamics, given by the Ehrenfest method, for the calculation of the auxiliary kernels. For the first time, we provide a detailed analysis of the dependence of the properties of the memory kernels obtained via different projection operators, namely, the thermal (Redfield-type) and population based (NIBA-type) projection operators. We further elucidate the conditions that lead to short-lived memory kernels and the regions of parameter space to which this program is best suited. Via a thorough analysis of the different closures available for the auxiliary kernels and the convergence properties of the self-consistently extracted memory kernel, we identify the mechanisms whereby the current approach leads to a significant improvement over the direct usage of standard semi- and quasi-classical dynamics.},

The Nakajima-Zwanzig-Mori formalism coupled to the self-consistent solution of the memory kernel has recently proven to be highly successful for the computation of nonequilibrium dynamical averages. Here, we extend this formalism to treat symmetrized equilibrium time correlation functions for the spin-boson model. Following the first paper in this series [A. Montoya-Castillo and D. R. Reichman, J. Chem. Phys. 144, 184104 (2016)], we use a Dyson-type expansion of the projected propagator to obtain a self-consistent solution for the memory kernel that requires only the calculation of normally evolved auxiliary kernels. We employ the approximate mean-field Ehrenfest method to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. Via comparison with numerically exact results for the correlation function Czz(t)=Re{$\langle\sigma$}z(0){$\sigma$}z(t){$\rangle$}, we show that the current scheme affords remarkable boosts in accuracy and efficiency over bare Ehrenfest dynamics. We further explore the sensitivity of the resulting dynamics to the choice of kernel closures and the accuracy of the initial canonical density operator.},

In this work we model the plasmonic enhancement mechanism of SERS with perturbation theory. We consider the excitation of plasmonic modes as an integral part of the Raman process and model SERS as higher-order Raman scattering. Additional resonances appear in the Raman cross section which correspond to the excitation of plasmons at the wavelengths of the incident and the Raman-scattered light. The analytic expression for the Raman cross section can be used to explain the outcome of resonance Raman measurements on SERS analytes as we demonstrate by comparison to experimental data. We also implement the theory to calculate the optical absorption cross section of plasmonic nanoparticles. From a comparison to experimental cross sections, we show that the coupling matrix elements need to be renormalized by a factor that accounts for the depolarization by the bound electrons and interband transitions in order to obtain the correct magnitude. With model calculations we demonstrate that interference of different scattering channels is key to understand the excitation energy dependence of the SERS enhancement for enhancement factors below 103.},

The accuracy and feasibility of the two procedures are demonstrated on the spin-boson model. We find that although simulating the electronic dynamics by direct application of the two LSC-based procedures leads to qualitatively different results that become increasingly less accurate with increasing time, restricting their use to calculating the memory kernel leads to an accurate description of the electronic dynamics. Comparison with a previously proposed procedure for calculating the memory kernel via the Ehrenfest method reveals that MH/LSC methods produce memory kernels that are better behaved at long times and lead to more accurate electronic dynamics.},

Within this framework, the effect of the nuclear degrees of freedom on the time evolution of the electronic reduced density matrix is fully captured by a memory kernel superoperator. However, the actual memory kernel depends on the choice of projection operator and is therefore not unique. Furthermore, calculating the memory kernel can be done in multiple ways that use different forms of projection-free inputs. Although the electronic dynamics is invariant to those choices when quantum-mechanically exact projection-free inputs are used, this is not the case when they are obtained via more feasible semiclassical or mixed quantum-classical approximate methods. Furthermore, the accuracy and numerical stability of the resulting electronic dynamics has been observed to be sensitive to the above-mentioned choices when approximate methods are used to calculate the projection-free inputs. In this article, we provide a systematic road map to 30 possible pathways for calculating the memory kernel and highlight how they are related as well as the ways in which they differ. We also compare the performance of different pathways in the context of the spin-boson benchmark model, with the projection-free inputs obtained via a mapping Hamiltonian linearized semiclassical method. In this case, we find that expressing the memory kernel with an exponential operator where the projection operator precedes the Liouvillian yields the most accurate and most numerically stable results.},

Within this framework, the effect of coupling to the nuclear degrees of freedom, as well as to any projected-out electronic reduced density matrix elements, is captured by a memory kernel and an inhomogeneous term, whose dimensionalities are dictated by the number of electronic reduced density matrix elements included in the subset of interest. We show that the memory kernel and inhomogeneous term within such GQMEs can be calculated from projection-free inputs of the same dimensionality, which can be cast in terms of the corresponding subsets of overall system two-time correlation functions. The applicability and feasibility of such reduced-dimensionality GQMEs is demonstrated on the two-state spin-boson benchmark model. To this end, we compare and contrast the following four types of GQMEs: (1) a full density matrix GQME, (2) a single-population scalar GQME, (3) a populations-only GQME, and (4) a subset GQME for any combination of populations and coherences. Using a method based on the mapping Hamiltonian approach and linearized semiclassical approximation to calculate the projection-free inputs, we find that while single-population GQMEs and subset GQMEs containing only one population are less accurate, they can still produce reasonable results and that the accuracy of the results obtained via the populations-only GQME and a subset GQME containing both populations is comparable to that obtained via the full density matrix GQMEs.},

The recently introduced modified approach to the GQME (M-GQME) corresponds to a specific implementation of the GQME that is geared toward simulating the dynamics of the electronic reduced density matrix in systems governed by an excitonic Hamiltonian. Such a Hamiltonian, which is often used for describing energy and charge transfer dynamics in complex molecular systems, is given in terms of diabatic electronic states that are coupled to each other and correspond to different nuclear Hamiltonians. Within the M-GQME approach, the effect of the nuclear degrees of freedom on the time evolution of the electronic density matrix is fully captured by a memory kernel superoperator, which can be obtained from short-lived (compared to the time scale of energy/charge transfer) projection-free inputs. In this paper, we test the ability of the M-GQME to predict the energy transfer dynamics within a seven-state benchmark model of the Fenna--Matthews--Olson (FMO) complex, with the short-lived projection-free inputs obtained via the Ehrenfest method. The M-GQME with Ehrenfest-based inputs is shown to yield accurate results across a wide parameter range. It is also found to dramatically outperform the direct application of the Ehrenfest method and to provide better-behaved convergence with respect to memory time in comparison to an alternative implementation of the GQME approach previously applied to the same FMO model.},

  abstract = {A simultaneously accurate and computationally efficient parametrization of the potential energy surface of molecules and materials is a long-standing goal in the natural sciences. While atom-centered message passing neural networks (MPNNs) have shown remarkable accuracy, their information propagation has limited the accessible length-scales. Local methods, conversely, scale to large simulations but have suffered from inferior accuracy. This work introduces Allegro, a strictly local equivariant deep neural network interatomic potential architecture that simultaneously exhibits excellent accuracy and scalability. Allegro represents a many-body potential using iterated tensor products of learned equivariant representations without atom-centered message passing. Allegro obtains improvements over state-of-the-art methods on QM9 and revMD17. A single tensor product layer outperforms existing deep MPNNs and transformers on QM9. Furthermore, Allegro displays remarkable generalization to out-of-distribution data. Molecular simulations using Allegro recover structural and kinetic properties of an amorphous electrolyte in excellent agreement with ab-initio simulations. Finally, we demonstrate parallelization with a simulation of 100 million atoms.},

Their accuracy heavily relies on the exchange-correlation energy functional, which encapsulates electron--electron interaction beyond the classical model. As its universal form remains undiscovered, approximated functionals constructed with heuristic approaches are used for practical studies. However, there are problems in their accuracy and transferability, while any systematic approach to improve them is yet obscure. In this study, we demonstrate that the functional can be systematically constructed using accurate density distributions and energies in reference molecules via machine learning. Surprisingly, a trial functional machine learned from only a few molecules is already applicable to hundreds of molecules comprising various first- and second-row elements with the same accuracy as the standard functionals. This is achieved by relating density and energy using a flexible feed-forward neural network, which allows us to take a functional derivative via the back-propagation algorithm. In addition, simply by introducing a nonlocal density descriptor, the nonlocal effect is included to improve accuracy, which has hitherto been impractical. Our approach thus will help enrich the DFT framework by utilizing the rapidly advancing machine-learning technique.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, the possibility of manipulating chemistry and material properties using hybrid light--matter states has stimulated considerable interest. Hybrid light--matter states can be generated by placing molecules in an optical cavity that is resonant with a molecular transition. Importantly, the hybridization occurs even in the dark because the coupling process involves the zero-point fluctuations of the optical mode (a.k.a. vacuum field) and the molecular transition. In other words, unlike photochemistry, no real photon is required to induce this strong coupling phenomenon. Strong coupling in general, but vibrational strong coupling (VSC) in particular, offers exciting possibilities for molecular and, more generally, material science. Not only is it a new tool to control chemical reactivity, but it also gives insight into which vibrations are involved in a reaction. This Perspective gives the underlying fundamentals of light--matter strong coupling, including a mini-tutorial on the practical issues to achieve VSC. Recent advancements in ``vibro-polaritonic chemistry'' and related topics are presented along with the challenges for this exciting new field.},

Using a resolution of the identity in the definition of partitioning, we reformulate the method in a computationally efficient manner that involves standard one- and two-electron integrals. We apply the developed algorithm to the 9 - ((1 - naphthyl) - methyl) - anthracene (A1N) molecule by partitioning A1N into anthracenyl and CH2 - naphthyl groups as subsystems and examine their electronic energies and populations for several excited states using configuration interaction singles method.

The basic equation thus obtained has a form similar to Bloch's kinetic equation and reduces to the latter in the limit of a system of weakly interacting particles. This is shown by generalizing a demping theoretical expansion of Kohn and Luttinger. It is found that the Einstein relation is valid only for the symmetric part of diffusion- and electric conductivity tensors, in agreement with Kasuya's suggestion.},

We find that the inclusion of particle exchange alters qualitatively the shape of the correlation function below the characteristic transition temperature but has no noticeable effect on the dynamics in the normal phase. The incoherent structure factor extracted from the velocity autocorrelation function is in very good agreement with neutron scattering data, reproducing the width, height, frequency shift, and asymmetry of the curves, as well as the observed increase in peak height characteristic of the superfluid phase. Our simulation demonstrates that the peak enhancement observed in the neutron scattering experiments below the transition temperature arises exclusively from particle exchange, illuminating the role of Bose-statistical effects on the dynamics of the quantum liquid.},

This is shown by comparing results for the decoherence rate of the exciton dynamics of a resumed perturbation theory with numerically exact real-time path-integral data. The exact decoherence rate for realistically slow solvent environments is significantly modified by multiphonon processes even in the weak coupling regime, while a one-phonon description is satisfactory only for fast environmental noise. Slow environments inhibit bath modes that are resonant with the exciton dynamics, thereby suppressing one-phonon transitions and enhancing multiphonon processes, which are typically not captured by lowest order perturbative treatments, such as Redfield or Lindblad approaches, even in more refined variants.},

A simple toy model of a single donor--acceptor pair with spatially separated chromophore sites allows one to investigate the influence of these spatial correlations on quantum coherent excitation transfer. The sound velocity of the solvent determines the wavelength of the environmental modes, which, in turn, has to be compared to the spatial distance of the chromophore sites. When the wavelength exceeds the distance between donor and acceptor sites, we find a strong suppression of decoherence. In addition, we consider two spatially separated donor--acceptor pairs under the influence of propagating environmental modes. Depending on their wavelengths fixed by the sound velocity of the solvent material, the spatial range of correlations may extend over typical interpair distances, which can lead to an increase in the decohering influence of the solvent.

The fluctuational spectra obtained there exhibit several discrete molecular vibrational modes and a surprisingly strong continuous background induced by the solvent. The latter alone causes overdamped excitonic dynamics, although its absolute strength might be somewhat overestimated. Nevertheless, it allows us to address the principal question of whether the discrete vibrational modes are strong enough to induce additional quantum coherent exciton dynamics which would be overdamped without them. We find that including them yields only negligible effects. By this, we can rule out a scenario of quantum coherence in the FMO exciton dynamics protected by the discrete molecular mode. Only when the dynamics is coherent already without the discrete modes, its coherence might be additionally enhanced.},

At its crudest level, the renormalized propagator is an ordinary matrix, thus the computational demands of the method are very modest, similar to those for propagating the bare system. Yet, test applications on dissipative two-level systems show that the method produces accurate results in demanding situations. By including memory on successively increasing time scales, the method is capable of capturing nonexponential kinetics induced by sluggish solvents.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the possibility is explored to speed up Hartree--Fock and hybrid density functional calculations by forming the Coulomb and exchange parts of the Fock matrix by different approximations. For the Coulomb part the previously introduced Split-RI-J variant (F. Neese, J. Comput. Chem. 24 (2003) 1740) of the well-known `density fitting' approximation is used. The exchange part is formed by semi-numerical integration techniques that are closely related to Friesner's pioneering pseudo-spectral approach. Our potentially linear scaling realization of this algorithm is called the `chain-of-spheres exchange' (COSX). A combination of semi-numerical integration and density fitting is also proposed. Both Split-RI-J and COSX scale very well with the highest angular momentum in the basis sets. It is shown that for extended basis sets speed-ups of up to two orders of magnitude compared to traditional implementations can be obtained in this way. Total energies are reproduced with an average error of {$<$}0.3kcal/mol as determined from extended test calculations with various basis sets on a set of 26 molecules with 20--200 atoms and up to 2000 basis functions. Reaction energies agree to within 0.2kcal/mol (Hartree--Fock) or 0.05kcal/mol (hybrid DFT) with the canonical values. The COSX algorithm parallelizes with a speedup of 8.6 observed for 10 processes. Minimum energy geometries differ by less than 0.3pm in the bond distances and 0.5{$^\circ$} in the bond angels from their canonical values. These developments enable highly efficient and accurate self-consistent field calculations including nonlocal Hartree--Fock exchange for large molecules. In combination with the RI-MP2 method and large basis sets, second-order many body perturbation energies can be obtained for medium sized molecules with unprecedented efficiency. The algorithms are implemented into the ORCA electronic structure system.},

ORCA features density functional theory, a range of wavefunction based correlation methods, semi-empirical methods, and even force-field methods. A range of solvation and embedding models is featured as well as a complete intrinsic to ORCA quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics engine. A specialty of ORCA always has been a focus on transition metals and spectroscopy as well as a focus on applicability of the implemented methods to ``real-life'' chemical applications involving systems with a few hundred atoms. In addition to being efficient, user friendly, and, to the largest extent possible, platform independent, ORCA features a number of methods that are either unique to ORCA or have been first implemented in the course of the ORCA development. Next to a range of spectroscopic and magnetic properties, the linear- or low-order single- and multi-reference local correlation methods based on pair natural orbitals (domain based local pair natural orbital methods) should be mentioned here. Consequently, ORCA is a widely used program in various areas of chemistry and spectroscopy with a current user base of over 22 000 registered users in academic research and in industry.},

  abstract = {Abstract In this paper, the SHARK integral generation and digestion engine is described. In essence, SHARK is based on a reformulation of the popular McMurchie/Davidson approach to molecular integrals. This reformulation leads to an efficient algorithm that is driven by BLAS level 3 operations. The algorithm is particularly efficient for high angular momentum basis functions (up to L = 7 is available by default, but the algorithm is programmed for arbitrary angular momenta). SHARK features a significant number of specific programming constructs that are designed to greatly simplify the workflow in quantum chemical program development and avoid undesirable code duplication to the largest possible extent. SHARK can handle segmented, generally and partially generally contracted basis sets. It can be used to generate a host of one- and two-electron integrals over various kernels including, two-, three-, and four-index repulsion integrals, integrals over Gauge Including Atomic Orbitals (GIAOs), relativistic integrals and integrals featuring a finite nucleus model. SHARK provides routines to evaluate Fock like matrices, generate integral transformations and related tasks. SHARK is the essential engine inside the ORCA package that drives essentially all tasks that are related to integrals over basis functions in version ORCA 5.0 and higher. Since the core of SHARK is based on low-level basic linear algebra (BLAS) operations, it is expected to not only perform well on present day but also on future hardware provided that the hardware manufacturer provides a properly optimized BLAS library for matrix and vector operations. Representative timings and comparisons to the Libint library used by ORCA are reported for Intel i9 and Apple M1 max processors.},

The spatial localization of electronic excitations is very sensitive to molecular distortions. Vibrational nuclear motions can couple to electronic dynamics driving changes in localization. The electronic energy transfer among multiple chromophores arises from several distinct mechanisms that can give rise to experimentally measured signals. Atomistic simulations of coupled electron-vibrational dynamics can help uncover the nuclear motions directing energy flow. Through careful analysis of excited state wave function evolution and a useful fragmenting of multichromophore systems, through-bond transport and exciton hopping (through-space) mechanisms can be distinguished. Such insights are crucial in the interpretation of fluorescence anisotropy measurements and can aid materials design. This Perspective highlights the interconnected vibrational and electronic motions at the foundation of nonadiabatic dynamics where nuclear motions, including torsional rotations and bond vibrations, drive electronic transitions.},

Typically, simulations must go beyond the Born--Oppenheimer approximation to account for non-adiabatic coupling between excited states. Indeed, non-adiabatic dynamics is commonly associated with exciton dynamics and photophysics involving charge and energy transfer, as well as exciton dissociation and charge recombination. Understanding the photoinduced dynamics in such materials is vital to providing an accurate description of exciton formation, evolution, and decay. This interdisciplinary field has matured significantly over the past decades. Formulation of new theoretical frameworks, development of more efficient and accurate computational algorithms, and evolution of high-performance computer hardware has extended these simulations to very large molecular systems with hundreds of atoms, including numerous studies of organic semiconductors and biomolecules. In this Review, we will describe recent theoretical advances including treatment of electronic decoherence in surface-hopping methods, the role of solvent effects, trivial unavoided crossings, analysis of data based on transition densities, and efficient computational implementations of these numerical methods. We also emphasize newly developed semiclassical approaches, based on the Gaussian approximation, which retain phase and width information to account for significant decoherence and interference effects while maintaining the high efficiency of surface-hopping approaches. The above developments have been employed to successfully describe photophysics in a variety of molecular materials.},

Cyanobacteria and plants provide the oxygen, food, fuel, fibers, and platform chemicals for life on Earth.

Light is absorbed by the pigment cofactors, and excitation energy is transferred among the antennae pigments and converted into chemical energy at very high efficiency. Oxygenic photosynthesis has existed for more than three billion years, during which its molecular machinery was perfected to minimize wasteful reactions. Light excitation transfer and singlet trapping won over fluorescence, radiation-less decay, and triplet formation. Photosynthetic reaction centers operate in organisms ranging from bacteria to higher plants. They are all evolutionarily linked. The crystal structure determination of photosynthetic protein complexes sheds light on the various partial reactions and explains how they are protected against wasteful pathways and why their function is robust.

  abstract = {Many-body interactions could lead to quantum thermalization, but long-range interactions provide an alternative. Although statistical mechanics describes thermal equilibrium states, these states may or may not emerge dynamically for a subsystem of an isolated quantum many-body system. For instance, quantum systems that are near-integrable usually fail to thermalize in an experimentally realistic time scale, and instead relax to quasi-stationary prethermal states that can be described by statistical mechanics, when approximately conserved quantities are included in a generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). We experimentally study the relaxation dynamics of a chain of up to 22 spins evolving under a long-range transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian following a sudden quench. For sufficiently long-range interactions, the system relaxes to a new type of prethermal state that retains a strong memory of the initial conditions. However, the prethermal state in this case cannot be described by a standard GGE; it rather arises from an emergent double-well potential felt by the spin excitations. This result shows that prethermalization occurs in a broader context than previously thought, and reveals new challenges for a generic understanding of the thermalization of quantum systems, particularly in the presence of long-range interactions.},

  abstract = {We consider a projection operator approach to the non-equilbrium Green function equation-of-motion (PO-NEGF EOM) method. The technique resolves problems of arbitrariness in truncation of an infinite chain of EOMs and prevents violation of symmetry relations resulting from the truncation (equivalence of left- and right-sided EOMs is shown and symmetry with respect to interchange of Fermi or Bose operators before truncation is preserved). The approach, originally developed by Tserkovnikov (1999 Theor. Math. Phys. 118 85) for equilibrium systems, is reformulated to be applicable to time-dependent non-equilibrium situations. We derive a canonical form of EOMs, thus explicitly demonstrating a proper result for the non-equilibrium atomic limit in junction problems. A simple practical scheme applicable to quantum transport simulations is formulated. We perform numerical simulations within simple models and compare results of the approach to other techniques and (where available) also to exact results.},

In the quantum context, Green's functions are correlation functions, from which it is possible to extract information from the system under study, such as the density of states, relaxation times and response functions. Despite its power and versatility, it is known as a laborious and sometimes cumbersome method. Here we introduce the equilibrium Green's functions and the equation-of-motion technique, exemplifying the method in discrete lattices of non-interacting electrons. We start with simple models, such as the two-site molecule, the infinite and semi-infinite one-dimensional chains, and the two-dimensional ladder. Numerical implementations are developed via the recursive Green's function, implemented in Julia, an open-source, efficient and easy-to-learn scientific language. We also present a new variation of the surface recursive Green's function method, which can be of interest when simulating simultaneously the properties of surface and bulk.},

  abstract = {The past decades have witnessed an explosion of interest in topological materials, and a lot of mathematical concepts have been introduced in condensed matter physics. Among them, the bulk-boundary correspondence is the central topic in topological physics, which has inspired researchers to focus on boundary physics. Recently, the concepts of topological phases have been extended to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, whose eigenvalues can be complex. Besides the topology, non-Hermiticity can also cause a boundary phenomenon called the non-Hermitian skin effect, which is an extreme sensitivity of the spectrum to the boundary condition. In this article, we review developments in non-Hermitian topological physics by focusing mainly on the boundary problem. As well as the competition between non-Hermitian and topological boundary phenomena, we discuss the topological nature inherent in non-Hermiticity itself.},

Here we report on room-temperature calculations of the excited-state dynamics in FMO using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and electronic structure calculations. Thus we obtain trajectories for the Hamiltonian of this system which contains time-dependent vertical excitation energies of the individual bacteriochlorophyll molecules and their mutual electronic couplings. The distribution of energies and couplings is analyzed together with possible spatial correlations. It is found that in contrast to frequent assumptions the site energy distribution is non-Gaussian. In a subsequent step, averaged wave packet dynamics is used to determine the exciton dynamics in the system. Finally, with the time-dependent Hamiltonian, linear and two-dimensional spectra are determined. The thus-obtained linear absorption line shape agrees well with experimental observation and is largely determined by the non-Gaussian site energy distribution. The two-dimensional spectra are in line with what one would expect by extrapolation of the experimental observations at lower temperatures and indicate almost total loss of long-lived coherences.},

It is much debated which role thermal effects play and if the observed low-temperature behavior arises also at physiological temperatures. To contribute to this debate, we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the coupling between the protein environment and the vertical excitation energies of individual bacteriochlorophyll molecules in the FMO complex of the green sulfur bacterium Chlorobaculum tepidum. The so-called spectral densities, which account for the environmental influence on the excited-state dynamics, are determined from temporal autocorrelation functions of the energy gaps between ground and first excited states of the individual pigments. Although the overall shape of the spectral density is found to be rather similar for all pigments, variations in their magnitude can be seen. Differences between the spectral densities for the pigments of the FMO monomer and FMO trimer are also presented.},

At the focus of the present study are the light-harvesting II complexes of the purple bacterium Rhodospirillum molischianum. The calculations are based on a time-dependent combination of molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemistry methods. Using a 12 ps long trajectory, different quantum chemical methods have been compared to each other. Furthermore, several approaches to determine the couplings between the individual chromophores have been tested. Correlations between energy gap fluctuations of different individual pigments are analyzed but found to be negligible. From the energy gap fluctuations, spectral densities are extracted which serve as input for calculations of optical properties and exciton dynamics. To this end, the spectral densities are tested by determining the linear absorption of the complete two-ring system. One important difference from earlier studies is given by the severely extended length of the trajectory along which the quantum chemical calculations have been performed. Due to this extension, more accurate and reliable data have been obtained in the low frequency regime which is important in the dynamics of electronic relaxation.},

  abstract = {Abstract Even in the modern era of precision medicine and immunotherapy, chemotherapy with platinum (Pt) drugs remains among the most commonly prescribed medications against a variety of cancers. Unfortunately, the broad applicability of these blockbuster Pt drugs is severely limited by intrinsic and/or acquired resistance, and high systemic toxicity. Considering the strong interconnection between kinetic lability and undesired shortcomings of clinical Pt drugs, we rationally designed kinetically inert organometallic Pt based anticancer agents with a novel mechanism of action. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays, we demonstrated that the development of a remarkably efficacious but kinetically inert Pt anticancer agent is feasible. Along with exerting promising antitumor efficacy in Pt-sensitive as well as Pt-resistant tumors in vivo, our best candidate has the ability to mitigate the nephrotoxicity issue associated with cisplatin. In addition to demonstrating, for the first time, the power of kinetic inertness in improving the therapeutic benefits of Pt based anticancer therapy, we describe the detailed mechanism of action of our best kinetically inert antitumor agent. This study will certainly pave the way for designing the next generation of anticancer drugs for effective treatment of various cancers.},

We are interested in a particular area of this field ? the training of system-specific MLPs for reactive systems ? with the goal of using these MLPs to accelerate free energy simulations of chemical and enzyme reactions. To help new members in our labs become familiar with the basic techniques, we have put together a self-guided Colab tutorial (https://cc-ats.github.io/mlp\_tutorial/), which we expect to be also useful to other young researchers in the community. Our tutorial begins with the introduction of simple feedforward neural network (FNN) and kernel-based (using Gaussian process regression, GPR) models by fitting the two-dimensional M{\"u}ller-Brown potential. Subsequently, two simple descriptors are presented for extracting features of molecular systems: symmetry functions (including the ANI variant) and embedding neural networks (such as DeepPot-SE). Lastly, these features will be fed into FNN and GPR models to reproduce the energies and forces for the molecular configurations in a Claisen rearrangement reaction.},

Here, in combination with the popular trajectory surface hopping dynamics method, we use a high-accuracy XMS-CASPT2 electronic structure level as a benchmark for assessing the performances of various post-Hartree--Fock methods (namely, CIS, ADC(2), CC2, and CASSCF) and exchange--correlation functionals (PBE, PBE0, and CAM-B3LYP) in a TD-DFT/TDA context, using the isomerization around a double bond as test case. Different relaxation pathways are identified, and the ability of the different methods to reproduce their relative importance and time scale is discussed. The results show that multireference electronic structure methods should be preferred, when studying nonadiabatic decay between excited and ground states. If not affordable, TD-DFT with TDA and hybrid functionals and ADC(2) are efficient alternatives but overestimate the nonradiative decay yield and thus may miss deexcitation pathways.},

The extended thawed Gaussian approximation is tested on electronic absorption spectra of the phenyl radical and benzene; calculated spectra reproduce experimental data and are much more accurate than standard global harmonic approaches, confirming the significance of anharmonicity. Moreover, the extended method provides a tool to quantify the Herzberg--Teller contribution; we show that in the phenyl radical, anharmonicity outweighs the Herzberg--Teller contribution, whereas in benzene, the Herzberg--Teller contribution is essential because the transition is electronically forbidden and the Condon approximation yields a zero spectrum. Surprisingly, both adiabatic harmonic spectra outperform those of the vertical harmonic model, which describes the Franck--Condon region better. Finally, we provide a simple recipe for orientationally averaging spectra, valid beyond the Condon approximation, and a relation among the transition dipole, its gradient, and nonadiabatic coupling vectors.},

Recently with the success of multiple new photoredox catalytic strategies that use supramolecular cages, there is a growing demand for photogeneration strategies of diverse reactive intermediates inside confined spaces, which will drive enzyme-like catalysis in real time. Here we report the excited state dynamics of a redox-active TTF radical cation and its corresponding dimethyl-derivative DiMeTTF inside a confined supramolecular cavity. We prepare the radical cation by spontaneous oxidation of neutral TTF upon incarceration inside a water-soluble nanocage Pd6L412+, and characterize it with a combination of resonance Raman and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Using broadband transient absorption spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the confined native TTF radical cation and its dimethyl derivative upon photoexcitation rapidly de-excite to form the hot ground state, thereby inhibiting further oxidation to a TTF+2 dication. We discuss our results in the context of excited state crossings of the radical cation potentials as well as modifying the cage energetics to generate a stable dication. Our work has important implications for the usage of such radical cations for photoactivated catalysis.},

However, COT possesses a non-vertical triplet state and therefore its detection has remained elusive through direct photoexcitation. Recently, fluorescent dyes synthesized by fusing COT with anthracene and phenazine ``wings'' have shown a large Stokes shift implying a significant conformational change in their excited singlet manifold. Here, using broadband transient absorption spectroscopy supported with electronic structure calculations, we demonstrate that intersystem crossing occurs in the planar COT conformation in these flapping dyes. We confirm that such a planar conformation in the triplet state does not impart aromaticity to the COT backbone, as previously predicted. Our work therefore provides the basis for the requisite structural design principles that would allow for triplet formation from excited singlet states in COT-based functional molecules.},

In particular, the nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO) approach treats specified nuclei, typically hydrogen nuclei, on the same level as the electrons. This approach enables the incorporation of nuclear quantum effects, such as nuclear delocalization, anharmonicity, zero-point energy, and tunneling, as well as non-Born--Oppenheimer effects directly into quantum chemistry calculations. Such effects impact optimized geometries, molecular vibrational frequencies, reaction paths, isotope effects, and dynamical simulations. Multicomponent density functional theory (NEO-DFT) and time-dependent DFT (NEO-TDDFT) achieve an optimal balance between computational efficiency and accuracy for computing ground and excited state properties, respectively. Multicomponent wave function based methods, such as the coupled cluster singles and doubles (NEO-CCSD) method for ground states and the equation-of-motion counterpart (NEO-EOM-CCSD) for excited states, attain similar accuracy without requiring any parametrization and can be systematically improved but are more computationally expensive. Variants of the orbital-optimized perturbation theory (NEO-OOMP2) method achieve nearly the accuracy of NEO-CCSD for ground states with significantly lower computational cost. Additional approaches for computing excited electronic, vibrational, and vibronic states include the delta self-consistent field (NEO-{$\Delta$}SCF), complete active space SCF (NEO-CASSCF), and nonorthogonal configuration interaction methods. Multireference methods are particularly important for describing hydrogen tunneling processes. Other types of multicomponent systems, such as those containing electrons and positrons, have also been studied within the NEO framework. The NEO approach allows the incorporation of nuclear quantum effects and non-Born--Oppenheimer effects for specified nuclei into quantum chemistry calculations in an accessible and computationally efficient manner.},

The gas-phase ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) technique has attracted significant attention as a unique tool for monitoring photochemical and photophysical processes at the all-atomic level with high temporal and spatial resolutions. In this work, we simulate the UED spectra of cyclobutanone using the trajectory surface hopping method at the extended multi-state complete active space second order perturbation theory (XMS-CASPT2) level and thereby predict the results of the upcoming UED experiments in the Stanford Linear Accelerator Laboratory. The simulated results demonstrate that a few pathways, including the C2 and C3 dissociation channels, as well as the ring opening channel, play important roles in the nonadiabatic reactions of cyclobutanone. We demonstrate that the simulated UED signal can be directly interpreted in terms of atomic motions, which provides a unique way of monitoring the evolution of the molecular structure in real time. Our work not only provides numerical data that help to determine the accuracy of the well-known surface hopping dynamics at the high XMS-CASPT2 electronic-structure level but also facilitates the understanding of the microscopic mechanisms of the photoinduced reactions in cyclobutanone.},

We propose a three-step model of singlet fission that includes two triplet-pair intermediates and show how transient spectroscopy can distinguish initially interacting triplet pairs from those that are spatially separated and noninteracting. We find that the interconversion of these two triplet-pair intermediates is limited by the rate of triplet transfer. These results clearly highlight the classical kinetic model of singlet fission and expose subtle details that promise to aid in resolving problems associated with triplet extraction.},

  abstract = {A goal in the kinetic characterization of a macromolecular system is the description of its slow relaxation processes via (i) identification of the structural changes involved in these processes and (ii) estimation of the rates or timescales at which these slow processes occur. Most of the approaches to this task, including Markov models, master-equation models, and kinetic network models, start by discretizing the high-dimensional state space and then characterize relaxation processes in terms of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a discrete transition matrix. The practical success of such an approach depends very much on the ability to finely discretize the slow order parameters. How can this task be achieved in a high-dimensional configuration space without relying on subjective guesses of the slow order parameters? In this paper, we use the variational principle of conformation dynamics to derive an optimal way of identifying the ``slow subspace'' of a large set of prior order parameters -- either generic internal coordinates or a user-defined set of parameters. Using a variational formulation of conformational dynamics, it is shown that an existing method---the time-lagged independent component analysis---provides the optional solution to this problem. In addition, optimal indicators---order parameters indicating the progress of the slow transitions and thus may serve as reaction coordinates---are readily identified. We demonstrate that the slow subspace is well suited to construct accurate kinetic models of two sets of molecular dynamics simulations, the 6-residue fluorescent peptide MR121-GSGSW and the 30-residue intrinsically disordered peptide kinase inducible domain (KID). The identified optimal indicators reveal the structural changes associated with the slow processes of the molecular system under analysis.},

  abstract = {The study of molecular polaritons beyond simple quantum emitter ensemble models (e.g., Tavis?Cummings) is challenging due to the large dimensionality of these systems and the complex interplay of molecular electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. This complexity constrains existing models to either coarse-grain the rich physics and chemistry of the molecular degrees of freedom or artificially limit the description to a small number of molecules. In this work, we exploit permutational symmetries to drastically reduce the computational cost of ab initio quantum dynamics simulations for large N. Furthermore, we discover an emergent hierarchy of timescales present in these systems, that justifies the use of an effective single molecule to approximately capture the dynamics of the entire ensemble, an approximation that becomes exact as N ? {$\infty$}. We also systematically derive finite N corrections to the dynamics and show that addition of k extra effective molecules is enough to account for phenomena whose rates scale as ?(N?k). Based on this result, we discuss how to seamlessly modify existing single-molecule strong coupling models to describe the dynamics of the corresponding ensemble. We call this approach collective dynamics using truncated equations (CUT-E), benchmark it against well-known results of polariton relaxation rates, and apply it to describe a universal cavity-assisted energy funneling mechanism between different molecular species. Beyond being a computationally efficient tool, this formalism provides an intuitive picture for understanding the role of bright and dark states in chemical reactivity, necessary to generate robust strategies for polariton chemistry.},

The following improvements to Heller's theory have been made: (a) derivation of new recurrence relations for the time-dependent wave packet overlap in the case of frequency changes between the ground and electronically excited states, (b) a new series expansion that gives insight into the nature of Savin's preresonance approximation, (c) incorporation of inhomogeneous broadening effects into the formalism at no additional computational cost, and (d) derivation of a new and simple short-time dynamics based equation for the Stokes shift that remains valid in the case of partially resolved vibrational structure. Our implementation of the time-dependent theory for the fitting of experimental spectra and the simulation of model spectra as well as the quantum mechanical calculation of the model parameters is discussed. The implementation covers all electronic structure approaches which are able to deliver ground- and excited-state energies and transition dipole moments. The technique becomes highly efficient if analytic gradients for the excited-state surface are available. In this case, the computational cost for the simultaneous prediction of ABS, fluorescence, and rR spectra is equal to that of a single excited-state geometry optimization step while the limitations of the short-time dynamics approximation are completely avoided. As a test case we discuss the well-known case of the strongly allowed 1Ag1{$\rightarrow$}1Bu1 transition in 1,3,5 trans-hexatriene in detail using method ranging from simple single-reference treatments to elaborate multireference electronic structure approaches. At the highest computational level, the computed spectra show the best agreement that has so far been obtained with quantum chemical methods for this problem.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present the implementation of efficient approximations to time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) within the Tamm--Dancoff approximation (TDA) for hybrid density functionals. For the calculation of the TDDFT/TDA excitation energies and analytical gradients, we combine the resolution of identity (RI-J) algorithm for the computation of the Coulomb terms and the recently introduced ``chain of spheres exchange'' (COSX) algorithm for the calculation of the exchange terms. It is shown that for extended basis sets, the RIJCOSX approximation leads to speedups of up to 2 orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods, as demonstrated for hydrocarbon chains. The accuracy of the adiabatic transition energies, excited state structures, and vibrational frequencies is assessed on a set of 27 excited states for 25 molecules with the configuration interaction singles and hybrid TDDFT/TDA methods using various basis sets. Compared to the canonical values, the typical error in transition energies is of the order of 0.01 eV. Similar to the ground-state results, excited state equilibrium geometries differ by less than 0.3 pm in the bond distances and 0.5{$^\circ$} in the bond angles from the canonical values. The typical error in the calculated excited state normal coordinate displacements is of the order of 0.01, and relative error in the calculated excited state vibrational frequencies is less than 1\%. The errors introduced by the RIJCOSX approximation are, thus, insignificant compared to the errors related to the approximate nature of the TDDFT methods and basis set truncation. For TDDFT/TDA energy and gradient calculations on Ag-TB2-helicate (156 atoms, 2732 basis functions), it is demonstrated that the COSX algorithm parallelizes almost perfectly (speedup {$\sim$}26--29 for 30 processors). The exchange-correlation terms also parallelize well (speedup {$\sim$}27--29 for 30 processors). The solution of the Z-vector equations shows a speedup of {$\sim$}24 on 30 processors. The parallelization efficiency for the Coulomb terms can be somewhat smaller (speedup {$\sim$}15--25 for 30 processors), but their contribution to the total calculation time is small. Thus, the parallel program completes a Becke3-Lee-Yang-Parr energy and gradient calculation on the Ag-TB2-helicate in less than 4 h on 30 processors. We also present the necessary extension of the Lagrangian formalism, which enables the calculation of the TDDFT excited state properties in the frozen-core approximation. The algorithms described in this work are implemented into the ORCA electronic structure system.},

Here, we use one such model as well as direct density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the phase equilibrium of water, hexagonal ice (Ih), and cubic ice (Ic), with an eye toward studying ice nucleation. The machine learning model is based on deep neural networks and has been trained on DFT data obtained using the SCAN exchange and correlation functional. We use this model to drive enhanced sampling simulations aimed at calculating a number of complex properties that are out of reach of DFT-driven simulations and then employ an appropriate reweighting procedure to compute the corresponding properties for the SCAN functional. This approach allows us to calculate the melting temperature of both ice polymorphs, the driving force for nucleation, the heat of fusion, the densities at the melting temperature, the relative stability of ices Ih and Ic, and other properties. We find a correct qualitative prediction of all properties of interest. In some cases, quantitative agreement with experiment is better than for state-of-the-art semiempirical potentials for water. Our results also show that SCAN correctly predicts that ice Ih is more stable than ice Ic.},

Here, we construct a series of system-bath model Hamiltonians for the PCET, where four localized electron-proton states are coupled to a thermal bath via a single solvent mode, and we employ MV-RPMD to simulate state population dynamics. Specifically, for each model, we identify the dominant PCET mechanism, and by comparing against rate theory calculations, we verify that our simulations correctly distinguish between concerted PCET, where the electron and proton transfer together, and sequential PCET, where either the electron or the proton transfers first. This work represents a first application of MV-RPMD to multi-level condensed phase systems; we introduce a modified MV-RPMD expression that is derived using a symmetric rather than asymmetric Trotter discretization scheme and an initialization protocol that uses a recently derived population estimator to constrain trajectories to a dividing surface. We also demonstrate that, as expected, the PCET mechanisms predicted by our simulations are robust to an arbitrary choice of the initial dividing surface.},

From this analysis we identify the lowest-order cavity-induced corrections to those quantities in the collective ultrastrong coupling regime and show that for even stronger interactions the presence of a single cavity mode can strongly modify extensive thermodynamic quantities of a large ensemble of dipoles. In this non-perturbative coupling regime we also observe a significant shift of the ferroelectric phase transition temperature and a characteristic broadening and collapse of the black-body spectrum of the cavity mode. Apart from a purely fundamental interest, these general insights will be important for identifying potential applications of ultrastrong-coupling effects, for example, in the field of quantum chemistry or for realizing quantum thermal machines.},

In this work, we also determined vibrational energies of the diatomics based on Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule. The goodness-of-fit to RKR data of 34 electronic states of 17 diatomics and the accuracy of the calculated vibrational energies were compared for the four oscillators and reported simultaneously for the first time in this study. These results showed that some oscillators demonstrated better goodness-of-fit than the others. Overall, the (Modified)-Rosen-Morse oscillators generated more accurate vibrational levels for most molecules studied, while Manning-Rosen oscillator was generally better for molecules in their excited electronic states. Although all oscillators performed well for more classical molecules, the Morse oscillator was superior to the other three in describing the ground states of 12C16O and 28Si32S.

The ad hoc addition of classical nuclear degrees of freedom and electron--nuclear coupling yields a classical Hamiltonian with one degree of freedom per each electronic state and also per each nuclear motion. Semiclassical quantization is applied to this Hamiltonian through the OMT, originally developed to describe nuclear dynamics on a single potential surface and subsequently generalized to include electronic transitions.

This generalization requires attention to time-ordering in quantum and classical propagators. Quantum response theory with the original quantum Hamiltonian is equivalent to classical response theory with the classical mapping Hamiltonian. We elucidate the structure of classical response theory with the mapping Hamiltonian, thereby generating classical versions of the two-sided quantum density operator diagrams conventionally used to describe spectroscopic processes. This formal development can provide a foundation for new semiclassical approximations to spectroscopic observables for models in which classical nuclear degrees of freedom are introduced into a mapping Hamiltonian describing electronic states.

  abstract = {The influence of exciton-vibrational coupling on the energy level structure, oscillator strength, and relaxation dynamics is investigated for two different excitonic dimer models. As compared with a purely electronic dimer, the inclusion of local vibrational modes within a vibronic dimer gives rise to a complex energy level structure including avoided crossings and changes of the nature of the exciton states from electronic to vibrational character. Besides these static properties, the dissipative dynamics of the two models is systematically investigated using Redfield relaxation theory. In case of the vibronic dimer this allows to treat selected vibrational degrees of freedom beyond the limits of perturbation theory and Markov approximation. It is demonstrated that the vibronic dimer gives rise to transient vibrational population trapping in the one-exciton manifold.},

  abstract = {In the field of electronic structure theory, many optimizations, ranging from accelerator offloading to exploitation of modern programming constructs, have been used to improve the performance of quantum chemistry software. However, one area that has remained largely unexplored is the space of novel programming languages that can provide unique benefits to quantum chemistry software development. One such programming language is Julia, an interpreted language designed to achieve the performance of high-performance, statically compiled languages. To assess the viability of Julia, the restricted Hartree--Fock method was implemented in a new quantum chemistry software package, JuliaChem. JuliaChem is a novel quantum chemistry software designed to take advantage of Julia as much as possible while achieving runtimes comparable to that of more established quantum chemistry software packages. Performance benchmarks against the popular quantum chemistry software package GAMESS, using the S22 test set of molecules, indicate that JuliaChem displays performance that is competitive with that of GAMESS. This shows that Julia could be a potentially useful tool for the field of electronic structure theory.},

  abstract = {In recent years, parallelism via multithreading has become extremely important to the optimization of high-performance electronic structure theory codes. Such multithreading is generally achieved via OpenMP constructs, using a fork-join threading model to enable thread-level data parallelism within the code. An alternative approach to multithreading is task-based parallelism, which displays multiple benefits relative to fork-join thread parallelism. A novel Restricted Hartree--Fock (RHF) algorithm, utilizing task-based parallelism to achieve optimal performance, was developed and implemented into the JuliaChem electronic structure theory software package. The new RHF algorithm utilizes a unique method of shell quartet batch creation, enabling construction and distribution of fine-grained shell quartet batches in a load-balanced manner using the Julia task construct. These shell quartet batches are then distributed statically across message-passing interface (MPI) ranks and dynamically across threads within an MPI rank, requiring no explicit inter-rank or interthread synchronization to do so. Compared to the hybrid MPI/OpenMP RHF algorithm present in the GAMESS software package, the task-based algorithm demonstrates speedups of up to {$\sim$}40\% for systems in the S22(3) test set of molecules, with system sizes up to {$\sim$}1000 basis functions. The JuliaChem algorithm demonstrates the viability of both the task-based parallelism model and the Julia programming language for construction of performant electronic structure theory codes targeting systems of a size of chemical interest.},

  abstract = {To determine the dynamics of a molecular aggregate under the influence of a strongly time-dependent perturbation within a dissipative environment is still, in general, a challenge. The time-dependent perturbation might be, for example, due to external fields or explicitly treated fluctuations within the environment. Methods to calculate the dynamics in these cases do exist though some of these approaches assume that the corresponding correlation functions can be written as a weighted sum of exponentials. One such theory is the hierarchical equations of motion approach. If the environment, however, is described by a complex spectral density or if its temperature is low, these approaches become very inefficient. Therefore, we propose a scheme based on a Chebyshev decomposition of the bath correlation functions and detail the respective quantum master equations within second-order perturbation theory in the environmental coupling. Similar approaches have recently been proposed for systems coupled to Fermionic reservoirs. The proposed scheme is tested for a simple two-level system and compared to existing results. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of the present Chebyshev approach are discussed.},

We show that system-reservoir correlations make a significant contribution to the heat statistics at low temperature and present a variational theory that quantitatively explains our numerical results. We also demonstrate a fluctuation-dissipation relation connecting the mean and variance of the heat distribution at high temperature. Our results reveal that system-bath interactions make a significant contribution to heat transfer even when the dynamics of the open system is effectively Markovian.

We show that, when the system--bath coupling is sufficiently strong, the Matsubara calculations can be converged by explicitly including up to M = 200 Matsubara modes, with the remaining modes included as a harmonic ``tail'' correction. The resulting Matsubara TCFs are in near-perfect agreement with the exact quantum TCFs, for non-linear as well as linear operators, at a temperature at which the TCFs are dominated by quantum thermal fluctuations. These results provide compelling evidence that incoherent classical dynamics can arise in the condensed phase at temperatures at which the statistics are dominated by quantum (Boltzmann) effects, as a result of smoothing of imaginary-time Feynman paths. The techniques developed here may also lead to efficient methods for benchmarking system--bath dynamics in the overdamped regime.},

However, it is well-known that the nonradiative decay pathway of the P-Z pair is significantly different from that of the G-C pair (Cui et al., Front. Chem. 2020, 8, 605117--605125). In this work, we study the excited state processes in Z using state-of-the-art multireference methods and dynamical techniques to ascertain the predominant nonradiative channels. We find that unlike in the natural NABs, the excited state processes in Z are driven primarily by the -NO2 group rotation. The electron-withdrawing effect of the -NO2 substituent plays a crucial role. We further ascertained that ultrafast deactivation channels are possible in Z and identified the stationary point geometries that are responsible for these channels.},

While recent studies on peptide aggregates have revealed absorption beyond 350 nm, monomeric proteins lacking aromatic amino acids, disulphide bonds, and active site prosthetic groups are expected to remain optically silent beyond 250 nm. Here, in a joint theoretical and experimental investigation, we report the distinctive UV-Vis absorption spectrum between 250 nm [{$\varepsilon$} = 7338 M-1 cm-1] and 800 nm [{$\varepsilon$} = 501 M-1 cm-1] in a synthetic 67 residue protein ({$\alpha$}3C), in monomeric form, devoid of aromatic amino acids. Systematic control studies with high concentration non-aromatic amino acid solutions revealed significant absorption beyond 250 nm for charged amino acids which constitute over 50\% of the sequence composition in {$\alpha$}3C. Classical atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of {$\alpha$}3C reveal dynamic interactions between multiple charged sidechains of Lys and Glu residues present in {$\alpha$}3C. Time-dependent density functional theory calculations on charged amino acid residues sampled from the MD trajectories of {$\alpha$}3C reveal that the distinctive absorption features of {$\alpha$}3C may arise from two different types of charge transfer (CT) transitions involving spatially proximal Lys/Glu amino acids. Specifically, we show that the charged amino (NH3+)/carboxylate (COO-) groups of Lys/Glu sidechains act as electronic charge acceptors/donors for photoinduced electron transfer either from/to the polypeptide backbone or to each other. Further, the sensitivity of the CT spectra to close/far/intermediate range of encounters between sidechains of Lys/Glu owing to the three dimensional protein fold can create the long tail in the {$\alpha$}3C absorption profile between 300 and 800 nm. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the sensitivity of {$\alpha$}3C absorption spectrum to temperature and pH-induced changes in protein structure. Taken together, our investigation significantly expands the pool of spectroscopically active biomolecular chromophores and adds an optical 250--800 nm spectral window, which we term ProCharTS (Protein Charge Transfer Spectra), for label free probes of biomolecular structure and dynamics.},

We present a theoretical approach to the scattering of molecules from metal surfaces that incorporates all nonadiabatic and quantum nuclear effects due to the coupling of the molecular degrees of freedom to the electrons in the metal. This is achieved with the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) approach, combined with a matrix product state representation in twin space. The method is applied to the scattering of nitric oxide from Au(111), for which strongly nonadiabatic energy loss during scattering has been experimentally observed, thus presenting a significant theoretical challenge. Since the HEOM approach treats the molecule--surface coupling exactly, it captures the interplay between nonadiabatic and quantum nuclear effects. Finally, the data obtained by the HEOM approach are used as a rigorous benchmark to assess various mixed quantum-classical methods, from which we derive insights into the mechanisms of energy dissipation and the suitable working regimes of each method.},

This method is systematically improvable and is shown to be valid in parameter regimes where perturbation theory-based methods qualitatively breakdown. As a test of the methodology presented here, we study a system--bath model for a coupled dimer for which we compare against numerically exact results and standard approximate perturbation theory-based calculations. Additionally, we study a monomer with discrete vibronic states that serves as the starting point for future investigation of vibronic signatures in nonlinear electronic spectroscopy.},

While the simulations based on CASSCF and MRCI optimized geometries are very similar to each other and fail to reproduce the experimentally measured intensities faithfully, the simulations obtained from SACCI optimized geometries are very close to the experimental spectra. The code developed for the multidimensional Franck-Condon simulations is described. It is shown that the integral storage problem common to the evaluation of multidimensional Franck-Condon integrals can be overcome by saving all quantities needed to disk. This strategy allows the code to run on computers with limited resources and is very well suited for application to molecules with a very large number of vibrational modes.},

This study uses orbital stabilization techniques combined with bound electronic structure methods, based on equation of motion coupled cluster or multi-reference methods, to calculate positions and widths of electronic resonances in pyridine that exist below 10~eV. We report four 2B1 and four 2A2 resonances, including one 2B1 not previously reported experimentally and two 2A2 resonances not reported at all in the literature. The two lower energy resonances are one-particle shape resonances, while the remaining are mixed or primarily core-excited resonances. Multi-reference perturbation theory provides the best description of these resonances, especially when their character is mixed. We describe the character of these resonances qualitatively and calculate Dyson orbitals, which provide information about their decay channels.},

Understanding the molecular mechanism of protein aggregation is essential for therapy development. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been shown as powerful tools to study protein aggregation. However, conventional MD simulations can hardly sample the whole conformational space of complex protein systems within acceptable simulation time as it can be easily trapped in local minimum-energy states. Many enhanced sampling methods have been developed. Among these, the replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) method has gained great popularity. By combining MD simulation with the Monte Carlo algorithm, the REMD method is capable of overcoming high energy-barriers easily and of sampling sufficiently the conformational space of proteins. In this chapter, we present a brief introduction to REMD method and a practical application protocol with a case study of the dimerization of the 11--25 fragment of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP(11--25)), using the GROMACS software. We also provide solutions to problems that are often encountered in practical use, and provide some useful scripts/commands from our research that can be easily adapted to other systems.},

The complex is a part of the light-harvesting system of green photosynthetic bacteria. Its lowest-energy absorption band, peaking at 826nm and responsible for the fluorescence, is believed to be due to Qy transitions of largely isolated molecules. One of the main merits of the used method compared with the more common fluorescence line narrowing is that the zero-phonon lines (ZPL) resonant with the excitation laser can be accurately measured, allowing precise determination of the Huang--Rhys (HR) factors, the main characteristics of the linear electron--phonon and vibronic coupling strengths. Over 60 individual vibrational modes of intra- and intermolecular origin have been resolved in the energy range of 45--1600cm-1. The small HR factors for these modes, ranging between 0.001 and 0.018, add up to a value of Svib=0.38{\textpm}0.07. The effective HR factor for the phonons, Sph, was found clearly wavelength-dependent, varying from {$\sim$}0.7 at short wavelengths to {$\sim$}0.3 at the long-wavelength tail of the absorption spectrum. Coupling between the BChl a molecules is likely responsible for this wavelength dependence.},

Interchromophore electronic couplings and interactions between pigments and the surrounding protein determine energy levels of excitonic states, and dictate the mechanism of energy flow. The excitonic structure (orientation of excitonic transition dipoles) of pigment-protein complexes is generally deduced indirectly from x-ray crystallography, in combination with predictions of transition energies and couplings in the chromophore site basis. We demonstrate that coarse-grained, excitonic, structural information in the form of projection angles between transition dipole moments can be obtained from the polarization-dependent, two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy of an isotropic sample, particularly when the nonrephasing or free polarization decay signal, rather than the photon echo signal, is considered. This method provides an experimental link between atomic and electronic structure, and accesses dynamical information with femtosecond time resolution. In an investigation of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex from green sulfur bacteria, the energy transfer connecting two particular exciton states in the protein was isolated as the primary contributor to a crosspeak in the nonrephasing two-dimensional spectrum at 400femtoseconds under a specific sequence of polarized excitation pulses. The results suggest the possibility of designing experiments using combinations of tailored polarization sequences to separate and monitor individual relaxation pathways.},

In most studies so far, the design of such structures has been based on the judicious manipulation of their refractive index properties. Recently, the prospect of simultaneously using gain and loss was suggested as a new way of achieving optical behaviour that is at present unattainable with standard arrangements. What facilitated these quests is the recently developed notion of `parity--time symmetry' in optical systems, which allows a controlled interplay between gain and loss. Here we report the experimental observation of light transport in large-scale temporal lattices that are parity--time symmetric. In addition, we demonstrate that periodic structures respecting this symmetry can act as unidirectional invisible media when operated near their exceptional points. Our experimental results represent a step in the application of concepts from parity--time symmetry to a new generation of multifunctional optical devices and networks.},

Such an evaluation must include a detailed treatment of site specific environmental influences on structural and electrostatic properties, but also their evolution in the temporal domain, because of the dynamic nature of the energy transfer process. In this work, we calculate the site energies of all 96 chlorophylls in a membrane-embedded model of PSI. The employed hybrid QM/MM approach using the multireference DFT/MRCI method in the QM region allows to obtain accurate site energies under explicit consideration of the natural environment. We identify energy traps and barriers in the antenna complex and discuss their implications for energy transfer to the reaction center. Going beyond previous studies, our model also accounts for the molecular dynamics of the full trimeric PSI complex. Via statistical analysis we show that the thermal fluctuations of single chlorophylls prevent the formation of a single prominent energy funnel within the antenna complex. These findings are also supported by a dipole exciton model. We conclude that energy transfer pathways may form only transiently at physiological temperatures, as thermal fluctuations overcome energy barriers. The set of site energies provided in this work sets the stage for theoretical and experimental studies on the highly efficient energy transfer mechanisms in PSI.},

The method is applied to the Fenna--Matthews--Olson (FMO) protein in order to investigate the influence of the different parts of the spectral density as well as correlations among these contributions on the energy transfer dynamics and on the temperature-dependent decay of coherences. The fluctuations and correlations in excitonic couplings as well as the correlations between coupling and site energy fluctuations are found to be 1 order of magnitude smaller in amplitude than the site energy fluctuations. Despite considerable amplitudes of that part of the spectral density which contains correlations in site energy fluctuations, the effect of these correlations on the exciton population dynamics and dephasing of coherences is negligible. The inhomogeneous charge distribution of the protein, which causes variations in local pigment--protein coupling constants of the normal modes, is responsible for this effect. It is seen thereby that the same building principle that is used by nature to create an excitation energy funnel in the FMO protein also allows for efficient dissipation of the excitons' excess energy.},

Now, we estimate the largest error in the set to be about 1\%. Validation of several methods against the new data indicates the exceptional robustness and accuracy of the SCS-MI-CCSD method. The second extension improves the coverage of nonequilibrium geometries. We introduce a new data set, S66a8, that samples intermolecular angular degrees of freedom in the S66 complexes. For each of the 66 complexes, eight displaced geometries have been constructed, systematically sampling possible rotations of the monomers. Interaction energies in this set are calculated at the CCSD(T)/CBS level consistently with the earlier introduced S66x8 data set that samples the intermolecular distance.},

One area of research that is of particular importance in many areas of chemistry, biology, and material science is the study of noncovalent interactions. Because these interactions are often strongly influenced by correlation effects, it is necessary to use computationally expensive high-order wave function methods to describe them accurately. Here, we present a large new database of interaction energies calculated using an accurate CCSD(T)/CBS scheme. Data are presented for 66 molecular complexes, at their reference equilibrium geometries and at 8 points systematically exploring their dissociation curves; in total, the database contains 594 points: 66 at equilibrium geometries, and 528 in dissociation curves. The data set is designed to cover the most common types of noncovalent interactions in biomolecules, while keeping a balanced representation of dispersion and electrostatic contributions. The data set is therefore well suited for testing and development of methods applicable to bioorganic systems. In addition to the benchmark CCSD(T) results, we also provide decompositions of the interaction energies by means of DFT-SAPT calculations. The data set was used to test several correlated QM methods, including those parametrized specifically for noncovalent interactions. Among these, the SCS-MI-CCSD method outperforms all other tested methods, with a root-mean-square error of 0.08 kcal/mol for the S66 data set.},

Unlike other quantum-dynamics approaches, the method scales well with the number of degrees of freedom, and for many polyatomic systems, the method may provide the most accurate predictions which can be practically computed. Instanton theory thus has the capability to produce useful data for many fields of low-temperature chemistry including spectroscopy, atmospheric and astrochemistry, as well as surface science. There is however still room for improvement in the efficiency of the numerical algorithms, and new theories are under development for describing tunneling in nonadiabatic transitions.},

In the second one, the dynamics in the IBr molecule in the presence of spin-orbit coupling after laser excitation is investigated. Due to an avoided crossing that originates from spin-orbit coupling, IBr dissociates into two channels: I + Br(2P3/2) and I + Br*(2P1/2).

  abstract = {WaveTrain is an open-source software for numerical simulations of chain-like quantum systems with nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions only. The Python package is centered around tensor train (TT, or matrix product) format representations of Hamiltonian operators and (stationary or time-evolving) state vectors. It builds on the Python tensor train toolbox Scikit\_tt, which provides efficient construction methods and storage schemes for the TT format. Its solvers for eigenvalue problems and linear differential equations are used in WaveTrain for the time-independent and time-dependent Schr{\"o}dinger equations, respectively. Employing efficient decompositions to construct low-rank representations, the tensor-train ranks of state vectors are often found to depend only marginally on the chain length N. This results in the computational effort growing only slightly more than linearly with N, thus mitigating the curse of dimensionality. As a complement to the classes for full quantum mechanics, WaveTrain also contains classes for fully classical and mixed quantum--classical (Ehrenfest or mean field) dynamics of bipartite systems. The graphical capabilities allow visualization of quantum dynamics ``on the fly,'' with a choice of several different representations based on reduced density matrices. Even though developed for treating quasi-one-dimensional excitonic energy transport in molecular solids or conjugated organic polymers, including coupling to phonons, WaveTrain can be used for any kind of chain-like quantum systems, with or without periodic boundary conditions and with NN interactions only. The present work describes version 1.0 of our WaveTrain software, based on version 1.2 of scikit\_tt, both of which are freely available from the GitHub platform where they will also be further developed. Moreover, WaveTrain is mirrored at SourceForge, within the framework of the WavePacket project for numerical quantum dynamics. Worked-out demonstration examples with complete input and output, including animated graphics, are available.},

  abstract = {In previous publications, it was shown that an efficient local coupled cluster method with single- and double excitations can be based on the concept of pair natural orbitals (PNOs) [F. Neese, A. Hansen, and D. G. Liakos, J. Chem. Phys.\hphantom{,}131, 064103 (2009)10.1063/1.3173827]. The resulting local pair natural orbital-coupled-cluster single double (LPNO-CCSD) method has since been proven to be highly reliable and efficient. For large molecules, the number of amplitudes to be determined is reduced by a factor of 105--106 relative to a canonical CCSD calculation on the same system with the same basis set. In the original method, the PNOs were expanded in the set of canonical virtual orbitals and single excitations were not truncated. This led to a number of fifth order scaling steps that eventually rendered the method computationally expensive for large molecules (e.g., \&gt;100 atoms). In the present work, these limitations are overcome by a complete redesign of the LPNO-CCSD method. The new method is based on the combination of the concepts of PNOs and projected atomic orbitals (PAOs). Thus, each PNO is expanded in a set of PAOs that in turn belong to a given electron pair specific domain. In this way, it is possible to fully exploit locality while maintaining the extremely high compactness of the original LPNO-CCSD wavefunction. No terms are dropped from the CCSD equations and domains are chosen conservatively. The correlation energy loss due to the domains remains below \&lt;0.05\%, which implies typically 15--20 but occasionally up to 30 atoms per domain on average. The new method has been given the acronym DLPNO-CCSD (``domain based LPNO-CCSD''). The method is nearly linear scaling with respect to system size. The original LPNO-CCSD method had three adjustable truncation thresholds that were chosen conservatively and do not need to be changed for actual applications. In the present treatment, no additional truncation parameters have been introduced. Any additional truncation is performed on the basis of the three original thresholds. There are no real-space cutoffs. Single excitations are truncated using singles-specific natural orbitals. Pairs are prescreened according to a multipole expansion of a pair correlation energy estimate based on local orbital specific virtual orbitals (LOSVs). Like its LPNO-CCSD predecessor, the method is completely of black box character and does not require any user adjustments. It is shown here that DLPNO-CCSD is as accurate as LPNO-CCSD while leading to computational savings exceeding one order of magnitude for larger systems. The largest calculations reported here featured \&gt;8800 basis functions and \&gt;450 atoms. In all larger test calculations done so far, the LPNO-CCSD step took less time than the preceding Hartree-Fock calculation, provided no approximations have been introduced in the latter. Thus, based on the present development reliable CCSD calculations on large molecules with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy are realized.},

  abstract = {In this work, the extension of the previously developed domain based local pair-natural orbital (DLPNO) based singles- and doubles coupled cluster (DLPNO-CCSD) method to perturbatively include connected triple excitations is reported. The development is based on the concept of triples-natural orbitals that span the joint space of the three pair natural orbital (PNO) spaces of the three electron pairs that are involved in the calculation of a given triple-excitation contribution. The truncation error is very smooth and can be significantly reduced through extrapolation to the zero threshold. However, the extrapolation procedure does not improve relative energies. The overall computational effort of the method is asymptotically linear with the system size O(N). Actual linear scaling has been confirmed in test calculations on alkane chains. The accuracy of the DLPNO-CCSD(T) approximation relative to semicanonical CCSD(T0) is comparable to the previously developed DLPNO-CCSD method relative to canonical CCSD. Relative energies are predicted with an average error of approximately 0.5 kcal/mol for a challenging test set of medium sized organic molecules. The triples correction typically adds 30\%--50\% to the overall computation time. Thus, very large systems can be treated on the basis of the current implementation. In addition to the linear C150H302 (452 atoms, \&gt;8800 basis functions) we demonstrate the first CCSD(T) level calculation on an entire protein, Crambin with 644 atoms, and more than 6400 basis functions.},

Our codebase provides a fully MPI+OpenMP parallelized implementation of the functional renormalization group (fRG) and the self-consistent parquet equations within the parquet approximation. It leverages vectorization to handle the additional complexity imposed by the Keldysh formalism, using optimized data structures and highly performant integration routines. Going beyond the results shown in the previous publication, the code includes functionality to perform fRG calculations in the multiloop framework, up to arbitrary loop order, including self-consistent self-energy iterations. Moreover, implementations of various regulators, such as hybridization, interaction, frequency, and temperature, are supplied.},

A discussion of how best to consistently process the chromophore excitation energy fluctuation correlation functions calculated in these classical simulations to obtain reliable site-dependent spectral densities is presented. The calculations reveal that chromophores that are close to the protein--water interface can experience strongly dissipative environmental interactions characterized by reorganization energies that can be as much as 2--3 times those of chromophores that are buried deep in the hydrophobic protein scaffolding. Using a linearized density matrix quantum propagation method, we demonstrate that the inhomogeneous system--bath model obtained from our site-dependent spectral density calculations gives results consistent with experimental dissipation and dephasing rates. Moreover, we show that this model can simultaneously enhance the energy-transfer rate and extend the decoherence time. Finally, we explore the influence of initially exciting different chromophores and mutating local environments on energy transfer through the network. These studies suggest that different pathways, selected by varying initial photoexcitation, can exhibit significantly different relaxation times depending on whether the energy-transfer path involves chromophores at the protein--solvent interface or if all chromophores in the pathway are buried in the protein.},

We tested the algorithms on three chemical systems, each including a hydrogen transfer, at different temperatures.

The method has been developed for studies of problems where a single configuration does not give a qualitatively correct description of the electronic structure. Examples of such cases are discussed in the chapter and it is illustrated how a valid wave function may be constructed. The concept of inactive and active orbitals is introduced and the complete active space wave function is defined. The choice of the active space is a crucial part of a compute dynamic correlation effects for multiconfigurational calculation. Without attempting to be complete, it has been illustrated that how this choice can be made for some typical electron structure problems. The problem of calculating the dynamic correlation energy is discussed with special emphasis on second order perturbation theory. Three-electron structure problems are discussed : ozone, the allyl radical, and the PbF molecule.},

We use a combined experimental and theoretical approach to show how a modest change in structure may be used to modify the exciton delocalization, tune electronic and vibrational coherences, and alter the mechanism of exciton transfer in covalently linked cofacial Zn-porphyrin dimers (mesobeta linked ABm-{$\beta$} and meso-meso linked AAm-m). While both ABm-{$\beta$} and AAm-m feature zinc porphyrins linked by a 1,2-phenylene bridge, differences in the interporphyrin connectivity set the lateral shift between macrocycles, reducing electronic coupling in ABm-{$\beta$} and resulting in a localized exciton. Pump-probe experiments show that the exciton dynamics is faster by almost an order of magnitude in the strongly coupled AAm-m dimer, and two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) identifies a vibronic coherence that is absent in ABm-{$\beta$}. Theoretical studies indicate how the interchromophore interactions in these structures, and their system-bath couplings, influence excitonic delocalization and vibronic coherence-enabled rapid exciton transport dynamics. Realtime path integral calculations reproduce the exciton transfer kinetics observed experimentally and find that the linking-modulated exciton delocalization strongly enhances the contribution of vibronic coherences to the exciton transfer mechanism, and that this coherence accelerates the exciton transfer dynamics. These benchmark molecular design, 2DES, and theoretical studies provide a foundation for directed explorations of nonclassical effects on exciton dynamics in multiporphyrin assemblies.},

Whereas F{\"o}rster theory relies on weak coupling between chromophores, and Redfield theory assumes the electronic excitations to be weakly coupled to fast chromophore vibrations, MASH is free from any perturbative or Markovian approximations. We illustrate this with an example application to the rate of energy transfer in a Frenkel-exciton dimer, showing that MASH interpolates correctly between the opposing regimes in which the F{\"o}rster and Redfield results are reliable. We then compare the three methods for a realistic model of the Fenna--Matthews--Olson complex with a structured vibrational spectral density and static disorder in the excitation energies. In this case there are no exact results for comparison so we use MASH to assess the validity of F{\"o}rster and Redfield theories. We find that F{\"o}rster theory is the more accurate of the two on the picosecond timescale, as has been shown previously for a simpler model of this particular light-harvesting complex. We also explore various ways to sample the initial electronic state in MASH and find that they all give very similar results for exciton dynamics.},

Our modification treats populations and coherences on an equal footing and is guaranteed to give populations in any electronic basis that tend to the correct quantum--classical equilibrium values in the long-time limit (assuming ergodicity). We demonstrate its accuracy by comparison with exact benchmark results for three- and seven-state models of the Fenna--Matthews--Olson complex, obtaining electronic populations and coherences that are significantly more accurate than those of fewest switches surface hopping and at least as good as those of any other semiclassical method we are aware of. Since these results were obtained by adapting the scheme of Mannouch and Richardson, we go on to compare our results with theirs for a variety of problems with two electronic states. We find that their method is sometimes more accurate, especially in the Marcus inverted regime. However, in other situations, the accuracies are comparable, and since our scheme can be used with multiple electronic states it can be applied to a wider variety of electronically nonadiabatic systems.},

Taking this into account, we developed molUP: a VMD plugin that offers a complete set of tools that enhance the preparation of QM and ONIOM (QM/MM, QM/QM, and QM/QM/MM) calculations. The starting structures for these calculations can be imported from different chemical formats. A set of tools is available to help the user to examine or modify any geometry parameter. This includes the definition of layers in ONIOM calculations, choosing fixed atoms during geometry optimizations, the recalculation or adjustment of the atomic charges, performing SCANs or IRC calculations, etc. molUP also extracts the geometries from the output files as well as the energies of each of them. All of these tasks are performed in an interactive GUI that is extremely helpful for the user. MolUP was developed to be easy to handle by inexperienced users, but simultaneously to be a fast and flexible graphical interface to allow the advanced users to take full advantage of this plugin.

  abstract = {Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics plays an essential role in exploring the time evolution of molecular systems. Various methods have been developed for this study, with varying accuracy and computational cost. One very successful among them is trajectory surface hopping, which propagates nuclei as classical trajectories using forces from a quantum description of the electrons and incorporates nonadiabatic effects through stochastic state changes during each trajectory propagation. A statistical analysis of an ensemble of the independent trajectories recovers the simulated system's behavior. This approach can give good results, but it is known to overlook nuclear quantum effects, leading to inaccurate predictions. Here, we present quantum dynamics from classical trajectories (QDCT), a new protocol to recover the quantum wavepacket from the classical trajectories generated by surface hopping. In this first QDCT implementation, we apply it to recover results at the multiple spawning level from postprocessing surface hopping precomputed trajectories. With a series of examples, we demonstrate QDCT's potential to improve the accuracy of the dynamics, correct decoherence effects, and diagnose problems or increase confidence in surface hopping results. All that comes at virtually no computational cost since no new electronic calculation is required.},

Our calculations reveal the role of potential features (anharmonicity and eigenvalue spectrum), both on short and long time scales, on the response function. Further, thermal excitation causes dramatic changes in the appearance of the response function, introducing symmetry with respect to the main diagonal. Finally, coupling to harmonic dissipative baths leads to decay of the response function (primarily along the {$\tau$}3 direction) and a broadening of the peaks in its Fourier transform. At high temperatures two-level-system baths are less efficient in destroying coherence than harmonic baths of similar parameters.},

Here we take a step in this direction. We establish physically distinct origins of recently reported apparent similarities between diagonal node-like CM lineshapes in bacteriochlorophyll monomers and multichromophoric photosynthetic reaction centers (RCs). The former arise when vibrational wavepackets survive on both ground and excited electronic states, while nodal lines in RCs arise when vibrational wavepackets that do not participate in energy transfer are coherently transferred to the acceptor. We resolve recent spectroscopic observations and illustrate new mechanistic insights gained by connecting microscopic interference between electronic relaxation pathways and observed CMs.},

We also find that efficient EETs are facilitated by site-dependent fluctuations that enhance the resonance condition between neighboring sites with large site energy differences and circumvent exciton trapping on the pathway to the RC.

Such semiclassical methods however commonly fail in quantitatively predicting the electronic-state populations in the long-time limit. Here we present a suggestion to minimize this difficulty by splitting the problem into two parts, one of which involves the identity and treating this operator by quantum-mechanical principles rather than with classical approximations. This strategy is applied to numerical simulations of spin-boson model systems, showing its potential to drastically improve the performance of LSC-IVR and related methods with no change in the equations of motion or the algorithm in general, but rather by simply using different functional forms of the observables.},

XE energies are estimated as a difference between the valence and core ionization eigenvalues, while the oscillator strengths are obtained within a frozen orbital approximation. This straightforward approach provides accurate XE energies without any need for core-hole reference states, empirical shifting parameters, or tuning of density functionals. To account for relativistic corrections to the core orbitals, we have formulated a scalar relativistic (sr) GKS-spRPA approach based on the spin-free X2C one-electron Hamiltonian. The sr-GKS-spRPA method provides highly reliable XE energies using uncontracted basis-sets on atoms where the core-hole is created prior to emission. For the largest basis-sets used in our study, using completely uncontracted polarized core-valence Dunning basis-sets, the mean absolute errors (MAEs) are within 0.7 eV compared to experimental reference values for a test-set consisting of 27 valence-to-core XE energies of molecules with second- and third-period elements. Considering a balance of accuracy and computational effort, we recommend the use of s-uncontracted def2-TZVP for second-period and all-uncontracted def2-TZVP for third-period elements. For this recommended basis-set, the MAE is 0.2 eV. The analytically continued sr-GKS-spRPA approach, with an O(N4) computational cost, enables efficient computation of XE spectra of molecules such as S8 and C60 with several core-hole states.},

This stabilization enables endothermic singlet fission processes and often results in long lifetimes of the bound triplet-pair state. However, triplets in close proximity demonstrate heightened recombination and reduced excited-state lifetimes.

In this work, we show that the dark Ag state in polyenes and/or carotenoids, along with the charge transfer states, plays a pivotal role in the SF process.

  abstract = {The dynamics of delocalized excitons in light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) can be investigated using different experimental techniques, and transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy is one of the most valuable methods for this purpose. A careful interpretation of TA spectra is essential for the clarification of excitation energy transfer (EET) processes occurring during light-harvesting. However, even in the simplest LHCs, a physical model is needed to interpret transient spectra as the number of EET processes occurring at the same time is very large to be disentangled from measurements alone. Physical EET models are commonly built by fittings of the microscopic exciton Hamiltonians and exciton-vibrational parameters, an approach that can lead to biases. Here, we present a first-principles strategy to simulate EET and transient absorption spectra in LHCs, combining molecular dynamics and accurate multiscale quantum chemical calculations to obtain an independent estimate of the excitonic structure of the complex. The microscopic parameters thus obtained are then used in EET simulations to obtain the population dynamics and the related spectroscopic signature. We apply this approach to the CP29 minor antenna complex of plants for which we follow the EET dynamics and transient spectra after excitation in the chlorophyll b region. Our calculations reproduce all the main features observed in the transient absorption spectra and provide independent insight on the excited-state dynamics of CP29. The approach presented here lays the groundwork for the accurate simulation of EET and unbiased interpretation of transient spectra in multichromophoric systems.},

Here, we analyse entanglement in multichromophoric light-harvesting complexes, and establish methods for quantification of entanglement by describing necessary and sufficient conditions for entanglement and by deriving a measure of global entanglement. These methods are then applied to the Fenna--Matthews--Olson protein to extract the initial state and temperature dependencies of entanglement. We show that, although the Fenna--Matthews--Olson protein in natural conditions largely contains bipartite entanglement between dimerized chromophores, a small amount of long-range and multipartite entanglement should exist even at physiological temperatures. This constitutes the first rigorous quantification of entanglement in a biological system. Finally, we discuss the practical use of entanglement in densely packed molecular aggregates such as light-harvesting complexes.},

At their center is the concept of memory. The explicit time-nonlocal description of memory is both protracted and elaborate. When physical intuition is at a premium, one would desire a more compact, yet complete, description. Here, we demonstrate how and when the time-convolutionless formalism constitutes such a description. In particular, by focusing on the dissipative dynamics of the spin-boson and Frenkel exciton models, we show how to: easily construct the time-local generator from reference reduced dynamics, elucidate the dependence of its existence on the system parameters and the choice of reduced observables, identify the physical origin of its apparent divergences, and offer analysis tools to diagnose their severity and circumvent their deleterious effects. We demonstrate that, when applicable, the time-local approach requires as little information as the more commonly used time-nonlocal scheme, with the important advantages of providing a more compact description, greater algorithmic simplicity, and physical interpretability. We conclude by introducing the discrete-time analog and a straightforward protocol to employ it in cases where the reference dynamics have limited resolution. The insights we present here offer the potential for extending the reach of dynamical methods, reducing both their cost and conceptual complexity.},

  abstract = {Modern 4-wave mixing spectroscopies are expensive to obtain experimentally and computationally. In certain cases, the unfavorable scaling of quantum dynamics problems can be improved using a generalized quantum master equation (GQME) approach. However, the inclusion of multiple (light--matter) interactions complicates the equation of motion and leads to seemingly unavoidable cubic scaling in time. In this paper, we present a formulation that greatly simplifies and reduces the computational cost of previous work that extended the GQME framework to treat arbitrary numbers of quantum measurements. Specifically, we remove the time derivatives of quantum correlation functions from the modified Mori--Nakajima--Zwanzig framework by switching to a discrete-convolution implementation inspired by the transfer tensor approach. We then demonstrate the method's capabilities by simulating 2D electronic spectra for the excitation-energy-transfer dimer model. In our method, the resolution of data can be arbitrarily coarsened, especially along the t2 axis, which mirrors how the data are obtained experimentally. Even in a modest case, this demands O(103) fewer data points. We are further able to decompose the spectra into one-, two-, and three-time correlations, showing how and when the system enters a Markovian regime where further measurements are unnecessary to predict future spectra and the scaling becomes quadratic. This offers the ability to generate long-time spectra using only short-time data, enabling access to timescales previously beyond the reach of standard methodologies.},

While experiments such as 2D spectroscopy and quantum control can now measure such quantities, the accurate simulation of such responses remains computationally expensive and sometimes impossible, depending on the system's complexity. A natural tool to employ is the generalized quantum master equation (GQME), which can offer computational savings by extending reference dynamics at a comparatively trivial cost. However, dynamical methods that can tackle chemical systems with atomistic resolution, such as those in the semiclassical hierarchy, often suffer from poor accuracy, limiting the credence one might lend to their results. By combining work on the accuracy-boosting formulation of semiclassical memory kernels with recent work on the multitime GQME, here we show for the first time that one can exploit a multitime semiclassical GQME to dramatically improve both the accuracy of coarse mean-field Ehrenfest dynamics and obtain orders of magnitude efficiency gains.},

Any N-point spin correlation function is equivalent to a 2N-point correlator of Majorana fermions. For a certain class of N-point spin correlation functions (including ``auto'' and ``pair-wise'' correlations) a further simplification is possible, as they can be reduced to N-point Majorana correlators. As a specific example we study the Bose--Kondo model. We develop a path-integral technique and obtain the spin relaxation rate from a saddle point solution of the theory. Furthermore, we show for the Ohmic case that fluctuations around the saddle point do not affect the correlation functions as long as the latter involve only a single spin projection. For illustration we calculate the 4-point spin correlation function corresponding to the noise of susceptibility.},

In this paper, a thorough presentation of the basic principles of the propagator is given. We give also a special emphasis on the details of the numerical implementation of the method.

  abstract = {The influence of exciton--vibrational coupling on the optical and transport properties of molecular aggregates is an old problem that gained renewed interest in recent years. On the experimental side, various nonlinear spectroscopic techniques gave insight into the dynamics of systems as complex as photosynthetic antennae. Striking evidence was gathered that in these protein--pigment complexes quantum coherence is operative even at room temperature conditions. Investigations were triggered to understand the role of vibrational degrees of freedom, beyond that of a heat bath characterized by thermal fluctuations. This development was paralleled by theory, where efficient methods emerged, which could provide the proper frame to perform non-Markovian and non-perturbative simulations of exciton--vibrational dynamics and spectroscopy. This review summarizes the state of affairs of the theory of exciton--vibrational interaction in molecular aggregates and photosynthetic antenna complexes. The focus is put on the discussion of basic effects of exciton--vibrational interaction from the stationary and dynamics points of view. Here, the molecular dimer plays a prominent role as it permits a systematic investigation of absorption and emission spectra by numerical diagonalization of the exciton--vibrational Hamiltonian in a truncated Hilbert space. An extension to larger aggregates, having many coupled nuclear degrees of freedom, becomes possible with the Multi-Layer Multi-Configuration Time-Dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) method for wave packet propagation. In fact it will be shown that this method allows one to approach the limit of almost continuous spectral densities, which is usually the realm of density matrix theory. Real system--bath situations are introduced for two models, which differ in the way strongly coupled nuclear coordinates are treated, as a part of the relevant system or the bath. A rather detailed exposition of the Hierarchy Equations Of Motion (HEOM) method will be given in terms of a stochastic decoupling ansatz. This method has become the standard in exciton--vibrational theory and illustrative examples will be presented as well as a comparison with ML-MCTDH. Applications will be shown for generic model systems as well as for small aggregates mimicking those formed by perylene bisimide dyes. Further, photosynthetic antenna complexes will be discussed, including spectral densities and the role of exciton--vibrational coupling in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy.},

The theoretical approach combines aspects of the linear vibronic coupling and Frenkel exciton models. Dynamics calculations are performed for the absorption spectrum and the electronic state populations using the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree approach. As an application, perylene bisimde J-type dimer and trimer aggregates are considered, including four tuning and one coupling mode per monomer. This leads to a dynamical model comprising up to 7 electronic states and 15 vibrational modes. The unknown nonadiabatic coupling strength is treated as a parameter that is chosen in accordance with available absorption spectra. This leaves some flexibility that can be limited by the clearly distinguishable population dynamics.},

Nonequilibrium Green's functions are a powerful tool to study interaction effects in quantum many-particle systems out of equilibrium, and to extract physically relevant information for the interpretation of experiments. We present the open-source software package NESSi (The Non-Equilibrium Systems Simulation package) which allows to perform many-body dynamics simulations based on Green's functions on the L-shaped Kadanoff--Baym contour. NESSi contains the library libcntr which implements tools for basic operations on these nonequilibrium Green's functions, for constructing Feynman diagrams, and for the solution of integral and integro-differential equations involving contour Green's functions. The library employs a discretization of the Kadanoff--Baym contour into time N points and a high-order implementation of integration routines. The total integrated error scales up to O(N-7), which is important since the numerical effort increases at least cubically with the simulation time. A distributed-memory parallelization over reciprocal space allows large-scale simulations of lattice systems. We provide a collection of example programs ranging from dynamics in simple two-level systems to problems relevant in contemporary condensed matter physics, including Hubbard clusters and Hubbard or Holstein lattice models. The libcntr library is the basis of a follow-up software package for nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory calculations based on strong-coupling perturbative impurity solvers.

Specifically, we focus on UV-active chromophores representing the building blocks of biological systems, from proteins to nucleic acids, describing our progress in developing computational tools and protocols for accurate simulation of their 2DUV spectra. The roadmap for accurate 2DUV spectroscopy simulations is illustrated starting with benchmarking of the excited-state manifold of the chromophoric units in a vacuum, which can be used for building exciton Hamiltonians for large-scale applications or as a reference for first-principles simulations with reduced computational cost, enabling treatment of minimal (still realistic) multi-chromophoric model systems. By adopting a static approximation that neglects dynamic processes such as spectral diffusion and population transfer, we show how 2DUV is able to characterize the ground-state conformational space of dinucleosides and small peptides comprising dimeric chromophoric units (in their native environment) by tracking inter-chromophoric electronic couplings. Recovering the excited-state coherent vibrational dynamics and population transfers, we observe a remarkable agreement between the predicted 2DUV spectra of the pyrene molecule and the experimental results. These results further led to theoretical studies of the excited-state dynamics in a solvated dinucleoside system, showing that spectroscopic fingerprints of long-lived excited-state minima along the complex photoinduced decay pathways of DNA/RNA model systems can be simulated at a reasonable computational cost. Our results exemplify the impact of accurate simulation of 2DES spectra in revealing complex physicochemical properties of fundamental biological systems and should trigger further theoretical developments as well as new experiments.},

Here we present the evaluation of these expressions with the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method. Application is made to pyrene, excited to its lowest bright excited state S2 which exhibits a sub-100-fs nonadiabatic decay to a dark state S1. The system is described by a linear vibronic coupling Hamiltonian, parametrized with multiconfiguration electronic structure methods. We show that the ultrafast nonadiabatic dynamics can have a remarkable effect on the spectral line shapes that goes beyond simple lifetime broadening. Furthermore, a widely employed approximate expression based on the time scale separation of dephasing and population relaxation is recast in the same theoretical framework. Application to pyrene shows the range of validity of such approximations.},

In this article we describe for the first time how PT becomes applicable in the framework of the ``Hierarchical Equations of Motion'' (HEOM) approach for treatment of open quantum systems. We extend the concept of formulating operators in HEOM space by deriving hierarchical equations of PT which lead to a shift in the excited state potential energy surface to compensate its displacement. While the assumption of thermal equilibration of the vibrational oscillators, introduced by PT, results in a stationary state in a monomer, in a dimer under the same assumption nonequilibrium dynamics appears because of the interplay of the transfer process and vibrational equilibration. Both vertical transitions generating a vibrationally hot state and initially equilibrated vibrational oscillators evolve toward the same stationary asymptotic state associated with polaron formation. The effect of PT on the dynamics of this process depends on initial excitation and basis representation of the electronic system. The developed approach facilitates a generic formulation of quantum master equations involving perturbative treatment of polaron dynamics.},

The steady-state ATP production rate as a function of incident light intensity is determined after identifying quinol turnover at the cytochrome                                                                        b                                            c                                                1                                                                                                              complex (cyt                                                   b                   ⁢                                        c                     1                                                                  ) as rate limiting and assuming that the quinone/quinol pool of about 900 molecules acts in a quasi-stationary state. For an illumination condition equivalent to 1\% of full sunlight, the vesicle exhibits an ATP production rate of 82 ATP molecules/s. The energy conversion efficiency of ATP synthesis at illuminations corresponding to 1\%--5\% of full sunlight is calculated to be 0.12--0.04, respectively. The vesicle stoichiometry, evolutionarily adapted to the low light intensities in the habitat of purple bacteria, is suboptimal for steady-state ATP turnover for the benefit of protection against over-illumination.                        ,              Photosynthesis, or the conversion of light energy into chemical energy, is a process that powers almost all life on Earth. Plants and certain bacteria share similar processes to perform photosynthesis, though the purple bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides uses a photosynthetic system that is much less complex than that in plants. Light harvesting inside the bacterium takes place in up to hundreds of compartments called chromatophores. Each chromatophore in turn contains hundreds of cooperating proteins that together absorb the energy of sunlight and convert and store it in molecules of ATP, the universal energy currency of all cells.             The chromatophore of primitive purple bacteria provides a model for more complex photosynthetic systems in plants. Though researchers had characterized its individual components over the years, less was known about the overall architecture of the chromatophore and how its many components work together to harvest light energy efficiently and robustly. This knowledge would provide insight into the evolutionary pressures that shaped the chromatophore and its ability to work efficiently at different light intensities.             Sener et al. now present a highly detailed structural model of the chromatophore of purple bacteria based on the findings of earlier studies. The model features the position of every atom of the constituent proteins and is used to examine how energy is transferred and converted. Sener et al. describe the sequence of energy conversion steps and calculate the overall energy conversion efficiency, namely how much of the light energy arriving at the microorganism is stored as ATP.             These calculations show that the chromatophore is optimized to produce chemical energy at low light levels typical of purple bacterial habitats, and dissipate excess energy to avoid being damaged under brighter light. The chromatophore's architecture also displays robustness against perturbations of its components. In the future, the approach used by Sener et al. to describe light harvesting in this bacterial compartment can be applied to more complex systems, such as those in plants.},

  abstract = {As most biological species, photosynthetic lifeforms have evolved to function optimally, despite thermal disorder and with fault tolerance. It remains a challenge to understand how this is achieved. To address this challenge, the function of the protein-pigment complex photosystem I (PSI) of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus is investigated theoretically. The recently obtained high-resolution structure of this complex exhibits an aggregate of 96 chlorophylls that are electronically coupled to function as a light-harvesting antenna complex. This paper constructs an effective Hamiltonian for the chlorophyll aggregate to describe excitation transfer dynamics and spectral properties of PSI. For this purpose, a new kinetic expansion method, the sojourn expansion, is introduced. Our study shows that at room temperature fluctuations of site energies have little effect on the calculated excitation lifetime and quantum yield, which compare favorably with experimental results. The efficiency of the system is found to be robust against ``pruning'' of individual chlorophylls. An optimality of the arrangement of chlorophylls is identified through the quantum yield in comparison with an ensemble of randomly oriented chlorophylls, though the quantum yield is seen to change only within a narrow interval in such an ensemble.},

At the center of theoretical chemistry are the developments of methodologies and computational tools for simulating charge and excitation energy transfer in solutions, biomolecules, and molecular aggregates. As a variety of these processes display non-Markovian behavior, classical computer simulation can be challenging due to exponential scaling with existing methods. With quantum computers holding the promise of efficient quantum simulations, in this paper, we present a new quantum algorithm based on Kraus operators that capture the exact non-Markovian effect at a finite temperature. The implementation of the Kraus operators on the quantum machine uses a combination of singular value decomposition (SVD) and optimal Walsh operators that result in shallow circuits. We demonstrate the feasibility of the algorithm by simulating the spin-boson dynamics and the exciton transfer in the Fenna--Matthews--Olson (FMO) complex. The NISQ results show very good agreement with the exact ones.},

However, incorporation of these effects along with the system's interaction with the thermal dissipative environments proves to be challenging. In this work, we demonstrate the possibility of utilizing the recently developed path integral Lindblad dynamics (PILD) method to study the linear spectra of molecular aggregates. PILD presents a uniquely powerful simulation technique for retaining the effects of the vibrations in a numerically exact manner through the Feynman--Vernon influence functional while incorporating the effects of losses in an empirical manner using the Lindbald master equation. As illustrations of this technique, we provide examples taken from chiral excitonic and polaritonic aggregates for which we simulate both the absorption spectra and circular dichroism (CD) spectra. We demonstrate that the effect of loss on particular states can differ not just on the basis of the symmetries of the state but also on the basis of complicated ``interactions'' of the structured dissipative environments with the system and its loss mechanisms. Due to the different selection rules between the absorption and CD spectra and the relative intensities and broadening of the peaks, the two linear spectra together give an interesting insight into the contributions of the various eigenstates to the correlation functions. While the focus here is on linear spectroscopy, it should be possible in the future to use PILD to study multidimensional spectra under loss mechanisms as well.},

Regularization serves to damp overestimated pairwise additive contributions, renormalizing first-order amplitudes such that the effects of higher-order correlations are incorporated. The optimal parameter values for the noncovalent and transition metal sets are 1.1, 0.7, and 0.4 for {$\kappa$}, {$\sigma$}, and {$\sigma$}2 regularizers, respectively. However, such regularization slightly degrades the accuracy of conventional MP2 for some small-molecule test sets, most of which have relatively large average frontier energy gaps.

  abstract = {Excitons are coherent excitations that travel over the semiconductor sample. Two types are commonly distinguished: Wannier excitons that are formed in inorganic materials, and Frenkel excitons that are formed in organic materials and rare-gas crystals. (i) Wannier excitons are made from delocalized conduction electrons and delocalized valence holes. The Coulomb interaction acts in two different ways. The intraband processes bind a free electron and a free hole into a Wannier exciton wave, while the interband processes separate the optically bright excitons made of spin--singlet electron--hole pairs from dark excitons made of spin--triplet pairs, with an additional transverse--longitudinal splitting that results from a nonanalytical Coulomb scattering which depends on the exciton wave vector direction with respect to the crystal axes. (ii) Frenkel excitons are made from highly localized excitations. The Coulomb interaction then acts in one way only, the intralevel Coulomb processes between sites, analogous to intraband processes, being negligible for on-site excitations in the tight-binding limit. The interlevel Coulomb processes, analogous to interband processes, produce both, the Frenkel exciton wave and its singular splitting, through electron--hole pair exchange between sites: the excitonic wave is produced by delocalizing the on-site excitations through the recombination of an electron--hole pair on one site and its creation on another site. These interlevel processes also split the exciton level in exactly the same singular way as for Wannier excitons. Importantly, since the interlevel Coulomb interaction only acts on spin--singlet pairs, just like the electron--photon interaction, optically dark pairs do not form excitonic waves; as a result, Frenkel excitons are optically bright in the tight-binding limit. We here present a fresh approach to Frenkel excitons in cubic semiconductor crystals, with a special focus on the spin and spatial degeneracies of the electronic states. This approach uses a second quantization formulation of the problem in terms of creation operators for electronic states on all lattice sites --- their creation operators being true fermion operators in the tight-binding limit valid for semiconductors hosting Frenkel excitons. This operator formalism avoids using cumbersome (6Ns{\texttimes}6Ns) Slater determinants -- 2 for spin, 3 for spatial degeneracy and Ns for the number of lattice sites -- to represent state wave functions out of which the Frenkel exciton eigenstates are derived. A deep understanding of the tricky Coulomb physics that takes place in the Frenkel exciton problem, is a prerequisite for possibly diagonalizing this very large matrix analytically. This is done in three steps: (i) the first diagonalization, with respect to lattice sites, follows from transforming excitations on the Ns lattice sites R{$\ell$} into Ns exciton waves Kn, by using appropriate phase prefactors; (ii) the second diagonalization, with respect to spin, follows from the introduction of spin--singlet and spin--triplet electron--hole pair states, through the commonly missed sign change when transforming electron-absence operators into hole operators; (iii) the third diagonalization, with respect to threefold spatial degeneracy, leads to the splitting of the exciton level into one longitudinal and two transverse modes, that result from the singular interlevel Coulomb scattering in the small Kn limit. To highlight the advantage of the second quantization approach to Frenkel exciton we here propose, over the standard first quantization procedure used for example in the seminal book by R. Knox, we also present detailed calculations of some key results on Frenkel excitons when formulated in terms of Slater determinants. Finally, as a way forward, we show how many-body effects between Frenkel excitons can be handled through a composite boson formalism appropriate to excitons made from electron--hole pairs with zero spatial extension. Interestingly, this Frenkel exciton study led us to reformulate the dimensionless parameter that controls exciton many-body effects --- first understood in terms of the Wannier exciton Bohr radius driven by Coulomb interaction -- as a parameter entirely driven by the Pauli exclusion principle between the exciton fermionic components. This formulation is not only valid for Wannier excitons but also for composite bosons like Cooper pairs.},

Although successful in many respects, several widely used descriptions only include an effective treatment of the protein-chromophore interactions. In this work, by combining an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation, time-dependent density functional theory, and open quantum system approaches, we successfully simulate the dynamics of the electronic energy transfer of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson pigment-protein complex. The resulting characteristic beating of populations and quantum coherences is in good agreement with the experimental results and the hierarchy equation of motion approach. The experimental absorption, linear, and circular dichroism spectra and dephasing rates are recovered at two different temperatures. In addition, we provide an extension of our method to include zero-point fluctuations of the vibrational environment. This work thus presents, to our knowledge, one of the first steps to explain the role of excitonic quantum coherence in photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes based on their atomistic and molecular description.},

A. 110, 20402 (2013)], directly probes the intermolecular degrees of freedom of the hydrogen-bond network. However, being a relatively new technique, its information content is not fully explored to date. While the spectroscopic signal can be simulated based on molecular dynamics simulation in connection with a water force field, it is difficult to relate spectroscopic signatures to the underlying microscopic features of the force field. Here, a completely different approach is taken that starts from an as simple as possible model, i.e., a single vibrational mode with electrical and mechanical anharmonicity augmented with homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening. An intuitive Feynman diagram picture is developed for all possible pulse sequences of hybrid 2D-Raman-THz spectroscopy. It is shown that the model can explain the experimental data essentially quantitatively with a very small set of parameters, and it is tentatively concluded that the experimental signal originates from the hydrogen-bond stretching vibration around 170 cm-1. Furthermore, the echo observed in the experimental data can be quantified by fitting the model. A dominant fraction of its linewidth is attributed to quasi-inhomogeneous broadening in the slow-modulation limit with a correlation time of 370 fs, reflecting the lifetime of the hydrogen-bond networks giving rise to the absorption band.},

They share in common that coherent and driven--dissipative quantum dynamics occur on an equal footing, creating genuine non-equilibrium scenarios without immediate counterpart in equilibrium condensed matter physics. This concerns both their non-thermal stationary states and their many-body time evolution. It is a challenge to theory to identify novel instances of universal emergent macroscopic phenomena, which are tied unambiguously and in an observable way to the microscopic drive conditions. In this review, we discuss some recent results in this direction. Moreover, we provide a systematic introduction to the open system Keldysh functional integral approach, which is the proper technical tool to accomplish a merger of quantum optics and many-body physics, and leverages the power of modern quantum field theory to driven open quantum systems.},

We investigate simpler 2 and 3-site model Hamiltonians in this work to understand the importance of coherence to efficient energy transfer. We compare the results of surface hopping simulation with that of numerically exact results and rate theories. Different parameters are analyzed, motivated by a photosynthetic molecular wire ? the FMO complex. A comparison of results from different theories shows that coherence can play an important role towards efficient energy transfer for certain parameters. When these coherences are important, even small couplings (of the order of 5?cm?1) in the Hamiltonian can significantly affect rates. Surface hopping simulations capture all the results correctly qualitatively. Rate theories, on the other hand, can differ significantly from numerically exact results when coherences become important. The results of this work should provide design guidelines for efficient energy transfer in molecular wires.},

Each of these measurements represents a significant development of the x-ray diffraction technique applied to the study of liquid water. Sources of uncertainty from statistical noise, Q-range, Compton scattering, and self-scattering are discussed. The oxygen-hydrogen contribution to the measured x-ray scattering pattern was subtracted using literature data to yield an experimental determination, with error bars, of the oxygen-oxygen pair-distribution function, gOO(r), which essentially describes the distribution of molecular centers. The extended Q-range and low statistical noise of these measurements has significantly reduced truncation effects and related errors in the gOO(r) functions obtained. From these measurements and error analysis, the position and height of the nearest neighbor maximum in gOO(r) were found to be 2.80(1) {\AA} and 2.57(5) respectively. Numerical data for the coherent differential x-ray scattering cross-section IX(Q), the oxygen-oxygen structure factor SOO(Q), and the derived gOO(r) are provided as benchmarks for calibrating force-fields for water.},

  abstract = {The development of accurate and transferable machine learning (ML) potentials for predicting molecular energetics is a challenging task. The process of data generation to train such ML potentials is a task neither well understood nor researched in detail. In this work, we present a fully automated approach for the generation of datasets with the intent of training universal ML potentials. It is based on the concept of active learning (AL) via Query by Committee (QBC), which uses the disagreement between an ensemble of ML potentials to infer the reliability of the ensemble's prediction. QBC allows the presented AL algorithm to automatically sample regions of chemical space where the ML potential fails to accurately predict the potential energy. AL improves the overall fitness of ANAKIN-ME (ANI) deep learning potentials in rigorous test cases by mitigating human biases in deciding what new training data to use. AL also reduces the training set size to a fraction of the data required when using naive random sampling techniques. To provide validation of our AL approach, we develop the COmprehensive Machine-learning Potential (COMP6) benchmark (publicly available on GitHub) which contains a diverse set of organic molecules. Active learning-based ANI potentials outperform the original random sampled ANI-1 potential with only 10\% of the data, while the final active learning-based model vastly outperforms ANI-1 on the COMP6 benchmark after training to only 25\% of the data. Finally, we show that our proposed AL technique develops a universal ANI potential (ANI-1x) that provides accurate energy and force predictions on the entire COMP6 benchmark. This universal ML potential achieves a level of accuracy on par with the best ML potentials for single molecules or materials, while remaining applicable to the general class of organic molecules composed of the elements CHNO.},

Our most reliable calculations involve MP4/6-311+G(2df,2p) energy evaluations at MP2/6-311+G(d,p) optimized structures. The lowest energy rearrangement pathway corresponds to the interchange of hydrogen atoms of the acceptor molecule within the Cs water dimer structure (1). This proceeds via a transition structure of C1 symmetry (2) and requires an energy of 0.59 kcal\,mol-1. The interchange of donor and acceptor molecules can be achieved via a transition structure with Ci symmetry (4) and requires an energy of 0.87 kcal\,mol-1. Finally, the interchange of hydrogen atoms of the donor molecule, via a C2v transition structure (9), requires 1.88 kcal\,mol-1. The rearrangements via 2 and 4 lead to complete scrambling of hydrogen atoms within the individual H2O moieties at a cost of 0.87 kcal\,mol-1; the transition structure 9 is not necessary for this process. The implications of these results with regard to the interpretation of spectroscopic data on the water dimer will be of interest.},

A recent breakthrough showed that the SCAN approximation can yield chemical accuracy for pure water in all its phases, but only when its density is corrected. This is a crucial step toward first-principles biosimulations. However, weak dispersion forces are ubiquitous and play a key role in noncovalent interactions among biomolecules, but are not included in the new approach. Moreover, na{\"i}ve inclusion of dispersion in HF-SCAN ruins its high accuracy for pure water. Here we show that systematic application of the principles of density-corrected DFT yields a functional (HF-r2SCAN-DC4) which recovers and not only improves over HF-SCAN for pure water, but also captures vital noncovalent interactions in biomolecules, making it suitable for simulations of solutions.},

The surface-hopping method is combined with linear-response time-dependent density functional theory calculations of adiabatic excited-state potential energy surfaces. To treat quantum transitions between arbitrary electronic Born--Oppenheimer states, we have implemented both numerical and analytical differentiation schemes for derivative nonadiabatic couplings. A numerical approach for the time-derivative nonadiabatic couplings together with an analytical method for calculating nonadiabatic coupling vectors is an efficient combination for surface-hopping approaches. Additionally, electronic decoherence schemes and a state reassigned unavoided crossings algorithm are implemented to improve the accuracy of the simulated dynamics and to handle trivial unavoided crossings. We apply our code to study the ultrafast decay of photoexcited benzene, including a detailed analysis of the potential energy surface, population decay timescales, and vibrational coordinates coupled to the excitation dynamics. We also study the photoinduced dynamics in trans-distyrylbenzene.

The AIMC method is a controlled approximation to nonadiabatic dynamics with a particular strength in the proper description of decoherence effects because of the branching of vibrational wavepackets at a level crossing. Here, we report a new implementation of the AIMC algorithm in the open source NWChem computational chemistry program. The framework combines linear-response time-dependent density functional theory with Ehrenfest mean-field theory to determine the equations of motion for classical trajectories. The multidimensional wave function is decomposed into a superposition of Gaussian coherent states guided by Ehrenfest trajectories (i.e., MCE approach), which can clone with fully quantum mechanical amplitudes and phases. By using an efficient time-derivative based nonadiabatic coupling approach within the AIMC method, all observables are calculated on-the-fly in the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics process. As a representative example, we apply our implementation to study the ultrafast photoinduced electronic and vibrational energy transfer in a pyridine molecule. The effects of the cloning procedure on electronic and vibrational coherence, relaxation and unidirectional energy transfer are discussed. This new AIMC implementation provides a high-level nonadiabatic molecular dynamics framework for simulating photoexcited dynamics in complex molecular systems and experimentally relevant ultrafast spectroscopic probes, such as nonlinear coherent optical and X-ray signals.},

  abstract = {The idea that water is a mixture of two distinct states is analyzed in some detail. It is shown that the known compressibility of water is in fact sufficiently small that for a volume of water of size 1 nm3, the density fluctuations are of order 4\% of the average density. This is much smaller than the {$\approx$}25\% density fluctuations that would be required for significant regions of high and low density water to occur on this volume scale. It is also pointed out that the density fluctuations in water are, if anything, smaller than those that occur in other common liquids which do not have the anomalous properties of water. It is shown that if the distribution of density fluctuations is unimodal, the system is in the one-phase region, and if bimodal, it is in the two-phase region. None of the liquid or amorphous phases of water explored in this work give any sign of being in the two-phase region. Existing neutron and X-ray scattering data on water in the amorphous phases, and in the stable liquid phases as a function pressure and temperature, are subject to a new set of empirical potential structure refinement simulations. These simulations are interrogated for their configurational entropy, using a spherical harmonic reconstruction of the full orientational pair correlation function. It is shown that the excess pair entropy derived from this function, plus the known perfect gas contributions, give a reasonable account of the total entropy of water, within the likely errors. This estimated entropy follows the expected declining trend with decreasing temperature. Evidence that higher density water will have higher entropy than lower density water emerges, in accordance with what is expected from the negative thermal expansion coefficient of water at low temperatures. However, this entropy increase is not large and goes through a maximum before declining at yet higher densities and pressures, in a manner reminiscent of what has been previously observed in the diffusion coefficient as a function of pressure. There is no evidence that ambient water can be regarded as patches of high density, high entropy and low density, low entropy liquid, as some have claimed, since high density water has a similar entropy to low density water. There is some evidence that the distinction between these two states will become more pronounced as the temperature is lowered. Extensive discussion of the use of order parameters to describe water structure is given, and it is pointed out that these indices generally cannot be used to infer two-state behavior.},

  abstract = {A theoretical approach for the multidimensional treatment of photoinduced proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes in solution is presented. This methodology is based on the multistate continuum theory with an arbitrary number of diabatic electronic states representing the relevant charge distributions in a general PCET system. The active electrons and transferring proton(s) are treated quantum mechanically, and the electron-proton vibronic free energy surfaces are represented as functions of multiple scalar solvent coordinates corresponding to the single electron and proton transfer reactions involved in the PCET process. A dynamical formulation of the dielectric continuum theory is used to derive a set of coupled generalized Langevin equations of motion describing the time evolution of these collective solvent coordinates. The parameters in the Langevin equations depend on the solvent properties, such as the dielectric constants, relaxation time, and molecular moment of inertia, as well as the solute properties. The dynamics of selected intramolecular nuclear coordinates, such as the proton donor-acceptor distance or a torsional angle within the PCET complex, may also be included in this formulation. A surface hopping method in conjunction with the Langevin equations of motion is used to simulate the nonadiabatic dynamics on the multidimensional electron-proton vibronic free energy surfaces following photoexcitation. This theoretical treatment enables the description of both sequential and concerted mechanisms, as well as more complex processes involving a combination of these mechanisms. The application of this methodology to a series of model systems corresponding to collinear and orthogonal PCET illustrates fundamental aspects of these different mechanisms and elucidates the significance of proton vibrational relaxation and nonequilibrium solvent dynamics.},

  abstract = {Electronic excitations in small aggregates, thin films, and crystals of conjugated organic molecules play a fundamental role in the operation of a wide array of organic-based devices including solar cells, transistors, and light-emitting diodes. Such excitations, or excitons, are generally spread out over several molecules: a balance between the delocalizing influence of resonant intermolecular coupling and the localizing influence of static and dynamic disorder determines the coherence range of the exciton. Because of the ``soft'' nature of organic materials, significant nuclear relaxation in the participating molecules also accompanies the electronic excitations. To properly understand energy or charge transport, one must treat intermolecular (excitonic) coupling, electron-vibrational coupling, and disorder on equal footing. In this Account, we review the key elements of a theoretical approach based on a multiparticle representation that describes electronic excitations in organic materials as vibronic excitations surrounded by a field of vibrational excitations. Such composite excitations are appropriately called Frenkel excitonic polarons. For many conjugated molecules, the bulk of the nuclear reorganization energy following electronic excitation arises from the elongation of a symmetric vinyl stretching mode with energy {$\sim$}1400 cm-1. To appreciate the impact of aggregation, we study how the vibronic progression of this mode, which dominates the isolated (solvated) molecule absorption and emission spectra, is distorted when molecules are close enough to interact with each other. As we demonstrate in this Account, the nature of the distortion provides a wealth of information about how the molecules are packed, the strength of the excitonic interactions between molecules, the number of molecules that are coherently coupled, and the nature of the disorder. We show that the aggregation-induced deviations from the Poissonian distribution of vibronic peak intensities take on two extremes identified with ideal H- and J-aggregates. The sign of the nearest neighbor electronic coupling, positive for H and negative for J, distinguishes the two basic aggregate forms. For several decades, researchers have known that H-aggregates exhibit blue-shifted absorption spectra and are subradiant while J-aggregates exhibit the opposite behavior (red-shifted absorption and superradiance). However, the exact inclusion of exciton-vibrational coupling reveals several more distinguishing traits between the two aggregate types: in H(J)-aggregates the ratio of the first two vibronic peak intensities in the absorption spectrum decreases (increases) with increasing excitonic coupling, while the ratio of the 0-0 to 0-1 emission intensities increases (decreases) with disorder and increases (decreases) with increasing temperature. These two extreme behaviors provide the framework for understanding absorption and emission in more complex morphologies, such as herringbone packing in oligo(phenylene vinylene)s, oligothiophenes and polyacene crystals, as well as the polymorphic packing arrangements observed in carotenoids.},

  abstract = {In quantum field theory, bare particles are dressed by a cloud of virtual particles to form physical particles. The virtual particles affect properties such as the mass and charge of the physical particles, and it is only these modified properties that can be measured in experiments, not the properties of the bare particles. The influence of virtual particles is prominent in the ultrastrong-coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), which has recently been realised in several condensed-matter systems. In some of these systems, the effective interaction between atom-like transitions and the cavity photons can be switched on or off by external control pulses. This offers unprecedented possibilities for exploring quantum vacuum fluctuations and the relation between physical and bare particles. We consider a single three-level quantum system coupled to an optical resonator. Here we show that, by applying external electromagnetic pulses of suitable amplitude and frequency, each virtual photon dressing a physical excitation in cavity-QED systems can be converted into a physical observable photon, and back again. In this way, the hidden relationship between the bare and the physical excitations can be unravelled and becomes experimentally testable. The conversion between virtual and physical photons can be clearly pictured using Feynman diagrams with cut loops.},

It combines a powerful RPMD implementation including chemical reaction rate calculations and biased periodic and nonperiodic samplings with a collection of easy to set up potential energy surface (PES) methodologies, thus delivering an all-inclusive approach. Most implemented PESs are based on the QMDFF and EVB-QMDFF methods. Where the quantum mechanically derived force field (QMDFF) can be set up for an arbitrary molecular system in a black-box fashion, the empirical valence bond (EVB)-QMDFF connects two QMDFFs and is able to represent the PES of a chemical reaction. With our previously published flavors of this composite method, PESs for almost arbitrary gas phase thermal ground state reactions can be set up. Given an optimized reaction path, the mechanism of the reaction can be classified and RPMD rate constants can be obtained via umbrella sampling and recrossing calculations on an EVB-QMDFF PES. Further, QMDFFs can be polymerized for the description of liquid systems. In this paper, the internal structure as well as the handling philosophy of Caracal are outlined. Further, examples of the different possible kinds of calculations are given.},

We describe a generalized approach for the application of machine learning to the classification of spectra which can be used as the basis for a wide variety of undergraduate projects. While our examples use FTIR and mass spectra, the approach could equally well be used with UV--visible, Raman, NMR, or indeed any other type of spectra. We summarize a number of different unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms that can be used to classify spectra into groups, and illustrate their application using data from three different projects carried out by fourth year chemistry undergraduates. The three projects investigated the ability of the various machine learning approaches to correctly classify spectra of a variety of fruits, whiskies, and teas, respectively. In all cases the algorithms were able to differentiate between the various samples used in each study, and the trained machine learning models could then be used to classify unknown samples with a high degree of accuracy ({$>$}98\% in many cases). Depending on the extent to which students are expected to write their own code to perform the data analysis, the general model adopted in this work can be adapted for a variety of purposes, from short (one to two day) practical exercises and workshops, to much longer independent student projects.},

Our method relies on expressing the system state and its propagator as a matrix product state and operator, respectively, and using a singular value decomposition to compress the description of the state as time evolves. We demonstrate the power and flexibility of our approach by numerically identifying the localisation transition of the Ohmic spin-boson model, and considering a model with widely separated environmental timescales arising for a pair of spins embedded in a common environment.},

With the advent of supercomputers containing large amounts of memory and many processors, the computational challenge posed by the previously intractable theoretical models can now be addressed. The hierarchy equations of motion present one such model and offer a powerful method that has remained underutilized so far, because of its considerable computational expense. By exploiting concurrent processing on parallel computers, the hierarchy equations of motion can be applied to biological-scale systems. Herein, we introduce the quantum dynamics software PHI that solves the hierarchical equations of motion. We describe the integrator employed by PHI and demonstrate PHI's scaling and efficiency running on large parallel computers by applying the software to the calculation of intercomplex excitation transfer between the light-harvesting complexes 1 (LH1) and 2 (LH2) of purple photosynthetic bacteria, which involves a 50-pigment system.},

We furthermore expect that FSSH (with decoherence) will be most robust when nonadiabatic transitions in an adiabatic basis are dictated primarily by derivative couplings that are presumably localized to crossing regions, rather than by small but pervasive off-diagonal force matrix elements. In the end, our results emphasize the strengths of and possibilities for the FSSH algorithm when decoherence is included, while also demonstrating the limitations of the FSSH algorithm and its inherent inability to follow the QCLE exactly.},

In this paper, we propose an inexpensive correction to standard FSSH dynamics wherein we explicitly model the decoherence of nuclear wave packets on distinct electronic surfaces. Our augmented fewest switches surface hopping approach is conceptually simple and, thus far, it has allowed us to capture several key features of the exact quantum results. Two points in particular merit attention. First, we obtain the correct branching ratios when a quantum particle passes through more than one region of nonadiabatic coupling. Second, our formalism provides a new and natural approach for rescaling nuclear momenta after a surface hop. Both of these features should become increasingly important as surface hopping schemes are applied to higher-dimensional problems.},

We highlight how one can partially derive surface hopping from the Schr{\"o}dinger equation in the adiabatic basis, how one can change basis within the surface hopping algorithm, and how one should understand and apply the notions of decoherence and wavepacket bifurcation. The question of time reversibility and detailed balance is also examined at length. Recent applications to photoexcited conjugated polymers are discussed briefly.},

Coherence emerges in a fundamentally different way for nonidentical and identical particles. For the latter, a unique contribution exists linked to indistinguishability that cannot occur for nonidentical particles. Here we experimentally demonstrate this additional contribution to quantum coherence with an optical setup, showing that its amount directly depends on the degree of indistinguishability and exploiting it in a quantum phase discrimination protocol. Furthermore, the designed setup allows for simulating fermionic particles with photons, thus assessing the role of exchange statistics in coherence generation and utilization. Our experiment proves that independent indistinguishable particles can offer a controllable resource of coherence and entanglement for quantum-enhanced metrology.},

The library is able to evaluate arbitrary integral expressions on top of p, r and {$\sigma$} operators with one-electron overlap and nuclear attraction, two-electron Coulomb and Gaunt operators for segmented contracted and/or generated contracted basis in Cartesian, spherical or spinor form. Using a symbolic algebra tool, new integrals are derived and translated to C code programmatically. The generated integrals can be used in various types of molecular properties. To demonstrate the capability of the integral library, we computed the analytical gradients and NMR shielding constants at both nonrelativistic and 4-component relativistic Hartree?Fock level in this work. Due to the use of kinetically balanced basis and gauge including atomic orbitals, the relativistic analytical gradients and shielding constants requires the integral library to handle the fifth-order electron repulsion integral derivatives. The generality of the integral library is achieved without losing efficiency. On the modern multi-CPU platform, Libcint can easily reach the overall throughput being many times of the I/O bandwidth. On a 20-core node, we are able to achieve an average output 8.3 GB/s for C60 molecule with cc-pVTZ basis. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The new expression opens the door for applications of NE-FGR in complex condensed-phase molecular systems described in terms of anharmonic force fields. We show that the linearized semiclassical expression for NE-FGR yields the exact fully quantum-mechanical result for the canonical Marcus model, where the coupling between donor and acceptor is assumed constant (the Condon approximation) and the donor and acceptor potential energy surfaces are parabolic and identical except for a shift in the equilibrium energy and geometry. For this model, we also present a comprehensive comparison between the linearized semiclassical expression and a hierarchy of more approximate expressions, in both normal and inverted regions and over a wide range of initial nonequilibrium states, temperatures, and frictions.},

In parallel, data-driven algorithms for learning interpretable continuum models have shown promising potential for the recovery of underlying partial differential equations (PDEs) from continuum simulation data. By contrast, learning macroscopic hydrodynamic equations for active matter directly from experiments or particle simulations remains a major challenge, especially when continuum models are not known a priori or analytic coarse graining fails, as often is the case for nondilute and heterogeneous systems. Here, we present a framework that leverages spectral basis representations and sparse regression algorithms to discover PDE models from microscopic simulation and experimental data, while incorporating the relevant physical symmetries. We illustrate the practical potential through a range of applications, from a chiral active particle model mimicking nonidentical swimming cells to recent microroller experiments and schooling fish. In all these cases, our scheme learns hydrodynamic equations that reproduce the self-organized collective dynamics observed in the simulations and experiments. This inference framework makes it possible to measure a large number of hydrodynamic parameters in parallel and directly from video data.},

The script itself is largely self-contained and could be used as a textbook on the topic of open quantum systems. The program of this course is based on a novel approach to the description of the open system dynamics: It is showed how the environmental degrees of freedom coupled to the system can be represented by a multi-component quasi-stochastic process. Using this representation one constructs the super-quasi-cumulant (or super-qumulant) expansion for the system's dynamical map-a parametrization that naturally lends itself for the development of a robust and practical perturbation theory.

  abstract = {The primary computational challenge when simulating nonadiabatic ab initio molecular dynamics is the unfavourable compute costs of electronic structure calculations with molecular size. Simple electronic structure theories, like time-dependent density functional theory within the Tamm?Dancoff approximation (TDDFT/TDA), alleviate this cost for moderately sized molecular systems simulated on realistic time scales. Although TDDFT/TDA does have some limitations in accuracy, an appealing feature is that, in addition to including electron correlation through the use of a density functional, the cost of calculating analytic nuclear gradients and nonadiabatic coupling vectors is often computationally feasible even for moderately sized basis sets. In this work, some of the benefits and limitations of TDDFT/TDA are discussed and analysed with regard to its applicability as a ?back-end? electronic structure method for the symmetric quasi-classical Meyer?Miller model (SQC/MM). In order to investigate the benefits and limitations of TDDFT/TDA, SQC/MM is employed to predict and analyse a prototypical example of excited-state hydrogen transfer in gas-phase malonaldehyde. Then, the ring-opening dynamics of selenophene are simulated, which highlight some of the deficiencies of TDDFT/TDA. Additionally, some new algorithms are proposed that speed up the calculation of analytic nuclear gradients and nonadiabatic coupling vectors for a set of excited electronic states.},

A chlorin, the core chromophore of a chlorophyll, is a dihydroporphyrin macrocycle that contains one pyrroline ring and three pyrrole rings. The dominant method for the synthesis of chlorins has entailed the derivatization of porphyrins. The present review covers the ostensibly simple conversion of porphyrins, regardless of synthetic or biological origin, to chlorins. The period covered encompasses the entire history since the beginnings of chlorin synthetic chemistry in the early 20th century through 2015. Representative transformations include hydrogenation, cycloaddition, annulation, and diverse ``breaking and mending'' approaches. Altogether, the synthesis of {\textbackslash}textgreater1000 chlorins or chlorin-like compounds (containing {\textbackslash}textgreater50 distinct pyrroline motifs) is described. Such diversity animates the question ``what structural features are essential for a chlorin to resemble chloro},

Ishizaki and Fleming further developed a hierarchy equation approach to describe this excitation population transfer dynamics in a model photosynthetic system. Here, we treat this same model system via the linearized approximation to the semiclassical (SC) initial value representation (IVR) for time correlation functions, in combination with the Meyer-Miller-Stock-Thoss model for the electronic degrees of freedom. Our approach is able to describe the long-lived quantum coherent dynamics, in excellent agreement with Ishizaki-Fleming's results. Moreover, the advantage of the linearlized SC-IVR approach is that it can be applied to any molecular model for which classical MD simulations are feasible, all the way up to a full all-atom MD simulation, while at the same time treating the electronic and nuclear dynamics in a consistent fashion.},

The key idea in this TD-SC-IVR method is to perform importance sampling of trajectories for the MC averages in the SC calculations with a sampling function that includes information about the final (time-evolved) values of the coordinates and momenta of trajectories in addition to (the usual) information of their initial values. This paper shows how this approach deals with electronically non-adiabatic dynamics, i.e. dynamics that involves coupled multiple electronic states. We suggest that a state-resolved sampling function may facilitate the efficient implementation of TD-SC-IVR for such processes. This is illustrated by application to the calculation of the nuclear momentum distribution function (i.e. the nuclear energy-loss spectrum) for a benchmark non-adiabatic scattering problem.},

Gaussian broadening of vertical electronic excitation energies of TCNQ-- from linear-response time-dependent density functional theory produces only one band, which is qualitatively incorrect. Thus, the harmonic vibrational modes of the two lowest doublet states were computed, and the vibronic UV--vis spectrum was simulated using the displaced harmonic oscillator approximation, the frequency-shifted harmonic oscillator approximation, and the full Duschinsky formalism. An efficient real-time generating function method was implemented to avoid the exponential complexity of conventional Franck--Condon approaches to vibronic spectra. The obtained UV--vis spectra for TCNQ-- agree well with experiment; the Duschinsky rotation is found to have only a minor effect on the spectrum. Born--Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations combined with calculations of the electronic excitation energies for a large number of molecular structures were also used for simulating the UV--vis spectrum. The Born--Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations yield a broadening of the energetically lowest peak in the absorption spectrum, but additional vibrational bands present in the experimental and simulated quantum harmonic oscillator spectra are not observed in the molecular dynamics simulations. Our results underline the importance of vibronic effects for the UV--vis spectrum of TCNQ--, and they establish an efficient method for obtaining vibronic spectra using a combination of linear-response time-dependent density functional theory and a real-time generating function approach.},

Often, these shifts are small, or an element is present in several oxidation states in the same sample, so that interpretation of the spectra is difficult without good reference data on binding energies of the likely constituents. In many cases, reference spectra taken from pure reference samples of the chemical components can aid the peak fitting procedure. However, reference materials are not always available, so that it becomes necessary to estimate the binding energies of likely components through quantum chemical calculations. In principle, such calculations have become much easier than in the past, due to the availability of powerful personal computers and excellent software. In practice, though, care needs to be taken in the approximations, assumptions, and settings used in applying such software to calculate binding energies. In this work, we present a general summary of the methods for the calculation of the core electron binding energies and compare the use of 2 of these methods using the popular ?GAUSSIAN? software package. Furthermore, a series of results for molecules, containing elements of the second and the third row of the periodic table, are presented and compared with experimental results, in order to establish the quality and fitness-for-purpose of the quantum chemical-based predictions.},

The module allows the computing of the evolution of the reduced density matrix, as well as spectral lineshapes. The truncation, filtering, and ?update list? schemes, as well as OpenMP parallelization, allow for further computational saving. The package is written in a mix of C++ and Python languages, delivering the best compromise between user friendliness and efficiency. The Python layer of the package takes advantage of standard Python libraries, such as h5py, which allows efficient storage and retrieval of the generated results. The package can be seamlessly used within Jupyter notebooks; its careful design shall provide the maximal convenience and intuitiveness to its users.},

In this work, we propose a method for simulating 2D electronic spectra based on a surface hopping approach. This approach self-consistently describes the interaction between photoactive chromophores and the environment, which allows us to reproduce a spectrally observable dynamic Stokes shift. Through an application to a dimer, the method is shown to also account for correct thermal equilibration of quantum populations, something that is of great importance for processes in the electronic domain. The resulting 2D spectra are found to nicely agree with hierarchy of equations of motion calculations. Contrary to the latter, our method is unrestricted in describing the interaction between the chromophores and the environment, and we expect it to be applicable to a wide variety of molecular systems.},

We explicitly demonstrate that using the truncated Dyson-series leads to divergences in the steady-state limit, thus making it impossible to be used for actual applications. In order to resolve the divergences, we propose a unique choice of initial condition for the reduced density matrix, which removes the divergences at each order. Our approach not only allows us to use the truncated Dyson-series, with a reasonable choice of initial condition, but also gives the expected result that the steady-state solutions should be independent of initial preparations. Using our improved Dyson series we evaluate the heat and electronic currents up to fourth-order in system-bath coupling, a considerable improvement over the standard quantum master equation techniques. We then numerically corroborate our theory for archetypal settings of linear systems using the exact nonequilibrium Green's function approach. Finally, to demonstrate the advantage of our approach, we deal with the nonlinear spin-boson model to evaluate heat current up to fourth-order and find signatures of cotunnelling process.},

Steady-state and flash-photolysis time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements on the zinc-porphyrin COF point to appreciable, broadband photoconductivity while transmission spectral measurements are indicative of extended {$\pi$}-conjugation.},

  abstract = {Abstract While the search for 2D organic semimetallic Dirac materials displaying, like graphene, a Dirac cone at the Fermi level remains active, attention is also being paid to the quantum phase transition from semimetal to antiferromagnet. Such a transition in graphene-like materials is predicted based on theoretical investigations of the 2D honeycomb lattice; it occurs (within a Hubbard model) when the on-site electron?electron Coulomb repulsion (U) is much larger than the nearest-neighbor inter-site electronic coupling (t). Here, monomers carrying long-lived radicals are considered and used as building blocks to design 2D hexagonal {$\pi$}-conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Both the nonmagnetic semimetallic phase and magnetically ordered phases are evaluated. It is found that the electronic coupling between adjacent radical centers in these COFs is more than an order of magnitude smaller than in graphene while the on-site Coulomb repulsion is reduced to a lesser extent. The resulting large U/t ratio drives these COFs into the antiferromagnetic side of the phase diagram. This work provides a first theoretical evidence of the realization of an antiferromagnetic Mott insulating phase in 2D {$\pi$}-conjugated COFs and allows a strategy to achieve quantum phase transitions from antiferromagnet to spin liquid and to semimetal to be outlined.},

These were assigned to superpositions of excitonic states, a controversial interpretation, as the strong chromophore--environment interactions in the complex suggest fast dephasing. Although it has been pointed out that vibrational motion produces similar spectral signatures, a concrete assignment of these oscillatory signals to distinct physical processes is still lacking. Here we revisit the coherence dynamics of the FMO complex using polarization-controlled two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy, supported by theoretical modelling. We show that the long-lived QBs are exclusively vibrational in origin, whereas the dephasing of the electronic coherences is completed within 240 fs even at 77 K. We further find that specific vibrational coherences are produced via vibronically coupled excited states. The presence of such states suggests that vibronic coupling is relevant for photosynthetic energy transfer.},

  abstract = {Coupling molecules to the confined light modes of an optical cavity is showing great promise for manipulating chemical reactions. However, to fully exploit this principle and use cavities as a new tool for controlling chemistry, a complete understanding of the effects of strong light--matter coupling on molecular dynamics and reactivity is required. While quantum chemistry can provide atomistic insight into the reactivity of uncoupled molecules, the possibilities to also explore strongly coupled systems are still rather limited due to the challenges associated with an accurate description of the cavity in such calculations. Despite recent progress in introducing strong coupling effects into quantum chemistry calculations, applications are mostly restricted to single or simplified molecules in ideal lossless cavities that support a single light mode only. However, even if commonly used planar mirror micro-cavities are characterized by a fundamental mode with a frequency determined by the distance between the mirrors, the cavity energy also depends on the wave vector of the incident light rays. To account for this dependency, called cavity dispersion, in atomistic simulations of molecules in optical cavities, we have extended our multi-scale molecular dynamics model for strongly coupled molecular ensembles to include multiple confined light modes. To validate the new model, we have performed simulations of up to 512 Rhodamine molecules in red-detuned Fabry--P{\'e}rot cavities. The results of our simulations suggest that after resonant excitation into the upper polariton at a fixed wave vector, or incidence angle, the coupled cavity-molecule system rapidly decays into dark states that lack dispersion. Slower relaxation from the dark state manifold into both the upper and lower bright polaritons causes observable photo-luminescence from the molecule--cavity system along the two polariton dispersion branches that ultimately evolves toward the bottom of the lower polariton branch, in line with experimental observations. We anticipate that the more realistic cavity description in our approach will help to better understand and predict how cavities can modify molecular properties.},

In femtosecond experiments, this energy transfer mechanism leads to excitation of delocalized, anticorrelated vibrational wavepackets on the ground electronic state that exhibit not only 2D spectroscopic signatures attributed to electronic coherence and oscillatory quantum energy transport but also a cross-peak asymmetry not previously explained by theory. A number of antennas have electronic energy gaps matching a pigment vibrational frequency with a small vibrational coordinate change on electronic excitation. Such photosynthetic energy transfer steps resemble molecular internal conversion through a nested intermolecular funnel.},

A combination of coherent excitation of several resonances with few-cycle pulses, and spectral decongestion along multiple spectral dimensions, has enabled new insights into wide ranging molecular scale phenomena, such as energy and charge delocalization in natural and artificial light-harvesting systems, hydrogen bonding dynamics in monolayers, and strong light--matter couplings in Fabry--P{\'e}rot cavities. However, measurements on ensembles have implied signal averaging over relevant details, such as morphological and energetic inhomogeneity, which are not rephased by the Fourier transform. Recent extension of these spectroscopies to provide diffraction-limited spatial resolution, while maintaining temporal and spectral information, has been exciting and has paved a way to address several challenging questions by going beyond ensemble averaging. The aim of this Perspective is to discuss the technological developments that have eventually enabled spatially resolved multidimensional electronic spectroscopies and highlight some of the very recent findings already made possible by introducing spatial resolution in a powerful spectroscopic tool.},

The discretized path integral converges very rapidly in the QUAPI representation, allowing efficient calculation of quantum correlation functions for sufficiently long times. No ad hoc assumption is introduced and thus these calculations yield the true quantum mechanical rate constants. The results presented in the paper demonstrate the applicability of the QUAPI methodology to practically all regimes of chemical interest, from thermal activation to deep tunneling, and the quantum transmission factor exhibits a Kramers turnover. Our calculations reveal an unusual step structure of the integrated reactive flux in the weak friction regime as well as quantum dynamical enhancement of the rate above the quantum transition state theory value at low temperatures, which is largely due to vibrational coherence effects. The quantum rates are compared to those obtained from classical trajectory simulations. We also use the numerically exact classical and quantum results to establish the degree of accuracy of several analytic and numerical approximations, including classical and quantum Grote--Hynes theories, semiclassical transition state theory (periodic orbit) estimates, classical and quantum turnover theories, and the centroid density approximation.},

In this approach, the optimal parameters are found iteratively by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix in the space spanned by the wave function and its first-order derivatives, making use of a strong zero-variance principle. We extend the method to optimize the exponents of the basis functions, simultaneously with all the other parameters, namely, the Jastrow, configuration state function, and orbital parameters. We show that the linear optimization method can be thought of as a so-called augmented Hessian approach, which helps explain the robustness of the method and permits us to extend it to minimize a linear combination of the energy and the energy variance. We apply the linear optimization method to obtain the complete ground-state potential energy curve of the C2 molecule up to the dissociation limit and discuss size consistency and broken spin-symmetry issues in quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We perform calculations for the first-row atoms and homonuclear diatomic molecules with fully optimized Jastrow--Slater wave functions, and we demonstrate that molecular well depths can be obtained with near chemical accuracy quite systematically at the diffusion Monte Carlo level for these systems.},

We also modify the mass-scaling used in the adiabatic QCMD algorithm, which allows the molecular dynamics timestep to be quadrupled, thus reducing the expense of a QCMD calculation to twice that of Cartesian centroid molecular dynamics for qTIP4P/F liquid water at 300~K, and eight times for ice at 150~K.},

Its asymptotic (ℏ {$\rightarrow$} 0) limit is the semiclassical golden-rule instanton rate theory, which rigorously approximates nuclear quantum effects, lends itself to efficient numerical computation, and gives physical insight into reaction mechanisms. However, the golden rule by itself becomes insufficient as the strength of the diabatic coupling increases, so higher-order terms must be additionally considered. In this work, we give a first-principles derivation of the next-order term beyond the golden rule, represented as a sum of three components. Two of them lead to new instanton pathways that extend the GR case and, among other factors, account for effects of recrossing on the full rate. The remaining component derives from the equilibrium partition function and accounts for changes in potential energy around the reactant and product wells due to diabatic coupling. The new semiclassical theory demands little computational effort beyond a GR instanton calculation. It makes it possible to rigorously assess the accuracy of the GR approximation and sets the stage for future work on general semiclassical nonadiabatic rate theories.},

We found that spins relax faster at lower temperature due to transitions through a quantum coherent state, as represented by the off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix, while it has been known that the spins relax slower due to suppression of thermal activation in a classical case. The decay of the spins are qualitatively similar regardless of the lattice sizes. The pathway of spin relaxation is analyzed under a sudden temperature drop condition.

  abstract = {An extension of the classical trajectory approach is proposed that may be useful in treating many types of nonadiabatic molecular collisions. Nuclei are assumed to move classically on a single potential energy surface until an avoided surface crossing or other region of large nonadiabatic coupling is reached. At such points the trajectory is split into two branches, each of which follows a different potential surface. The validity of this model as applied to the HD2+ system is assessed by numerical integration of the appropriate semiclassical equations. A 3d ``trajectory surface hopping'' treatment of the reaction of H+ with D2 at a collision energy of 4 eV is reported. The excellent agreement with experiment is an encouraging indication of the potential usefulness of this approach.},

  abstract = {Transport phenomena are ubiquitous throughout the science, engineering, and technology disciplines as it concerns energy, mass, charge, and information exchange between systems. In particular, energy transport in the nanoscale regime has attracted significant attention within the physical science community due to its potential to explain complex phenomena like the electronic energy transfer in molecular crystals or the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO)/light harvesting complexes in photosynthetic bacteria with long time coherences. Energy transport in these systems is highly affected by environmental noise but surprisingly not always in a detrimental way. It was recently found that situations exist where noise actually enhances the transport phenomena. Such noise can take many forms, but can be characterised in three basic behaviors: quantum, correlation in time, or space. All have been shown potential to offer an energy transport enhancement. The focus of this work is on quantum transport caused by stochastic environment with spatio-temporal correlation. We consider a multi-site nearest neighbor interaction model with pure dephasing environmental noise with spatio-temporal correlation and show how an accelerated rate for the energy transfer results especially under negative spatial correlation (anti-correlation). Spatial anti-correlation provides another control parameter to help one establish the most efficient transfer of energy and may provide new insights into the working of exciton transport in photosynthetic complexes. Further the usage of spatio-temporal correlated noise may be a beneficial resource for efficient transport in large scale quantum networks.},

  abstract = {Machine learning has emerged as a promising paradigm to study the quantum dissipative dynamics of open quantum systems. To facilitate the use of our recently published ML-based approaches for quantum dissipative dynamics, here we present an open-source Python package MLQD (https://github.com/Arif-PhyChem/MLQD), which currently supports the three ML-based quantum dynamics approaches: (1) the recursive dynamics with kernel ridge regression (KRR) method, (2) the non-recursive artificial-intelligence-based quantum dynamics (AIQD) approach and (3) the blazingly fast one-shot trajectory learning (OSTL) approach, where both AIQD and OSTL use the convolutional neural networks (CNN). This paper describes the features of the MLQD package, the technical details, optimization of hyperparameters, visualization of results, and the demonstration of the MLQD's applicability for two widely studied systems, namely the spin-boson model and the Fenna--Matthews--Olson (FMO) complex. To make MLQD more user-friendly and accessible, we have made it available on the Python Package Index (PyPi) platform and it can be installed via Image 1. In addition, it is also available on the XACS cloud computing platform (https://XACScloud.com) via the interface to the MLatom package (http://MLatom.com).

Since condensed matter physics deals with those phenomena in which a system of quanta exist together with a variety of macroscopic objects at finite temperature, it may be said to manifest the fundamental properties of quantum field theory in its widest sense. Thus condensed matter physics has served as a powerful motivating force throughout the growth and development of quantum field theory. This process was indeed initiated by the celebrated Matsubara formalism of finite temperature Green's function method. This process is by no means complete since recent developments in many areas of physics demand a more sophisticated understanding with regard to the fundamental nature of quantum field theory.A brief description of this maturing process of quantum field theory in the past, present and prospects for the future will be the main content of this article.},

The result for the Drude weight is identical to the one obtained 20 years ago based on the Kohn formula and TBA. We numerically evaluate the Drude weight for anisotropies ∆ = cos({$\gamma$}) with {$\gamma$} = {$\pi$}n/m, n {$\leq$} m integer and coprime. We prove, furthermore, that the high-temperature asymptotics for general {$\gamma$} = {$\pi$}n/m---obtained by analysis of the quantum transfer matrix eigenvalues---agrees with the bound which has been obtained by the construction of quasi-local charges.},

From the quantum instanton expression, we analyze the contributions to the rate constant in terms of minimum-action paths and find that two such paths dominate the expression. For symmetric barriers, these two paths join together to describe the semiclassical instanton periodic orbit. However, for asymmetric barriers, one of the two paths takes an unphysically low energy and dominates the expression, leading to order-of-magnitude errors in the rate predictions. Nevertheless, semiclassical instanton theory remains accurate. We conclude that semiclassical instanton theory can be obtained directly from the semiclassical limit of the quantum instanton only for symmetric systems. We suggest a modification of the quantum instanton approach which avoids sampling the spurious path and thus has a stronger connection to semiclassical instanton theory, giving numerically accurate predictions even for very asymmetric systems in the low temperature limit.},

As the tunneling spectra are highly sensitive to both the details of the quantum dynamics and the potential energy surface, our calculations are a validation of the MB-Pol surface as well as the accuracy of PIMD. The favorable scaling of PIMD with system size paves the way for calculations of tunneling splittings in large, nonrigid molecular systems with motions that cannot be treated accurately by other methods, such as the semiclassical instanton.},

Using a fully variational relativistic theoretical method recently developed by the authors, we investigate the origins of ultrafast ISC in the [Pt(ppy) ({$\mu$}-tBu2pz)]2 complex (ppy = phenylpyridine, pz = pyrazolate). Spin-orbit coupling values, evaluated along a Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics trajectory, are used to propagate electronic populations in time.

It is based on a minimization of the energy functional using a new set of variables to perform orbital transformations. With this method convergence of the wave function is guaranteed. Preconditioners with different computational cost and efficiency have been constructed. Depending on the preconditioner, the method needs a number of iterations that is very similar to the established diagonalization--DIIS approach, in cases where the latter converges well. Diagonalization of the Kohn--Sham matrix can be avoided and the sparsity of the overlap and Kohn--Sham matrix can be exploited. If sparsity is taken into account, the method scales as O(MN2), where M is the total number of basis functions and N is the number of occupied orbitals. The relative performance of the method is optimal for large systems that are described with high quality basis sets, and for which the density matrices are not yet sparse. We present a benchmark calculation on a DNA crystal containing 2{\texttimes}12 base pairs, solvent and counter ions (2388 atoms), using a TZV(2d,2p) basis (38{$\mkern1mu$}688 basis functions) and conclude that the electronic structure of systems of this size can now be studied routinely.},

We study such a nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation in full generality: we derive general equations of motion for the Gaussian's parameters, demonstrate time reversibility and norm~conservation, and analyze conservation of energy, effective energy, and symplectic structure. We also describe efficient, high-order geometric integrators for the numerical solution of this nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation. The general theory is illustrated by examples of this family of Gaussian wavepacket dynamics, including the variational and nonvariational thawed and frozen Gaussian approximations and their special limits based on the global harmonic, local harmonic, single-Hessian, local cubic, and local quartic approximations for the potential energy. We also propose a new method by augmenting the local cubic approximation with a single fourth derivative. Without substantially increasing the cost, the proposed ``single-quartic'' variational Gaussian approximation improves the accuracy over the local cubic approximation and, at the same time, conserves both the effective energy and symplectic structure, unlike the much more expensive local quartic approximation.

In the present article, an extension of the CHARMM force field to drug-like molecules is presented. The resulting CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF) covers a wide range of chemical groups present in biomolecules and drug-like molecules, including a large number of heterocyclic scaffolds. The parametrization philosophy behind the force field focuses on quality at the expense of transferability, with the implementation concentrating on an extensible force field. Statistics related to the quality of the parametrization with a focus on experimental validation are presented. Additionally, the parametrization procedure, described fully in the present article in the context of the model systems, pyrrolidine, and 3-phenoxymethylpyrrolidine will allow users to readily extend the force field to chemical groups that are not explicitly covered in the force field as well as add functional groups to and link together molecules already available in the force field. CGenFF thus makes it possible to perform ``all-CHARMM'' simulations on drug-target interactions thereby extending the utility of CHARMM force fields to medicinally relevant systems. {\copyright} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {The photosynthetic apparatus of plants and bacteria combine atomically precise pigment--protein complexes with dynamic membrane architectures to control energy transfer on the 10--100 nm length scales. Recently, synthetic materials have integrated photosynthetic antenna proteins to enhance exciton transport, though the influence of artificial packing on the excited-state dynamics in these biohybrid materials is not fully understood. Here, we use the adaptive hierarchy of pure states (adHOPS) to perform a formally exact simulation of excitation energy transfer within artificial aggregates of light-harvesting complex 2 (LH2) with a range of packing densities. We find that LH2 aggregates support a remarkable exciton diffusion length ranging from 100 nm at a biological packing density to 300 nm at the densest packing previously suggested in an artificial aggregate. The unprecedented scale of these formally exact calculations also underscores the efficiency with which adHOPS simulates excited-state processes in molecular materials.},

As with all versions of the QI approach, the rate is expressed wholly in terms of the (quantum) Boltzmann operator (which, for complex systems, can be evaluated by Monte Carlo path integral methods). Test calculations on some simple model problems show the SQI1 model to be slightly less accurate than the original version of the QI approach, but it is the easiest version to implement; it requires only a constrained free-energy calculation, location of the (transition-state) DS so as to maximize this free energy, and the curvature (second derivative) of the free energy at this maximum.},

Application of the framework is independent of the transport regime and includes bath-induced decoherence effects. This model shows that the relationship between molecular conductances and charge transfer rates follows a power-law. The nonlinear rate--conductance relationship is shown to arise from differences in the charge transport barrier heights and from differences in environmental decoherence rates for the two experiments. This model explains otherwise puzzling correlations between molecular conductances and electrochemical kinetics.},

We present a detailed study of the different ways the coupling terms in recently-developed XF-based mixed quantum-classical approximations are evaluated, where either truly coupled trajectories, or auxiliary trajectories that mimic the coupling are used, and discuss their effect in both a surface-hopping framework as well as the rigorously-derived coupled-trajectory mixed quantum-classical approach.},

This synergy between theory and experiment promises to yield a deeper understanding of photochemical processes, offering valuable insights into the behavior of complex systems at the molecular level. However, the ability of theoretical models to predict ultrafast experimental outcomes has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we aim to predict the electron diffraction signals of an upcoming ultrafast photochemical experiment using high-level electronic structure calculations and non-adiabatic dynamics simulations. In particular, we perform trajectory surface hopping with extended multi-state complete active space with second order perturbation simulations for understanding the photodissociation of cyclobutanone (CB) upon excitation at 200~nm. Spin--orbit couplings are considered for investigating the role of triplet states. Our simulations capture the bond cleavage after ultrafast relaxation from the 3s Rydberg state, leading to the formation of the previously observed primary photoproducts: CO + cyclopropane/propene (C3 products), ketene, and ethene (C2 products). The ratio of the C3:C2 products is found to be about 1:1. Within 700~fs, the majority of trajectories transition to their electronic ground state, with a small fraction conserving the initial cyclobutanone ring structure. We found a minimal influence of triplet states during the early stages of the dynamics, with their significance increasing at later times. We simulate MeV-ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) patterns from our trajectory results, linking the observed features with specific photoproducts and the underlying structural dynamics. Our analysis reveals highly intense features in the UED signals corresponding to the photochemical processes of CB. These features offer valuable insights into the experimental monitoring of ring opening dynamics and the formation of C3 and C2 photoproducts.},

  abstract = {The calculation of X-ray emission spectroscopy with equation of motion coupled cluster theory (EOM-CCSD), time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), and resolution of the identity single excitation configuration interaction with second-order perturbation theory (RI-CIS(D)) is studied. These methods can be applied to calculate X-ray emission transitions by using a reference determinant with a core-hole, and they provide a convenient approach to compute the X-ray emission spectroscopy of large systems since all of the required states can be obtained within a single calculation, removing the need to perform a separate calculation for each state. For all of the methods, basis sets with the inclusion of additional basis functions to describe core orbitals are necessary, particularly when studying transitions involving the 1s orbitals of heavier nuclei. EOM-CCSD predicts accurate transition energies when compared with experiment; however, its application to larger systems is restricted by its computational cost and difficulty in converging the CCSD equations for a core-hole reference determinant, which become increasing problematic as the size of the system studied increases. While RI-CIS(D) gives accurate transition energies for small molecules containing first row nuclei, its application to larger systems is limited by the CIS states providing a poor zeroth-order reference for perturbation theory which leads to very large errors in the computed transition energies for some states. TDDFT with standard exchange-correlation functionals predicts transition energies that are much larger than experiment. Optimization of a hybrid and short-range corrected functional to predict the X-ray emission transitions results in much closer agreement with EOM-CCSD. The most accurate exchange-correlation functional identified is a modified B3LYP hybrid functional with 66\% Hartree--Fock exchange, denoted B66LYP, which predicts X-ray emission spectra for a range of molecules including fluorobenzene, nitrobenzene, acetone, dimethyl sulfoxide, and CF3Cl in good agreement with experiment.},

The number of classical trajectories, thus the computational cost, grows rapidly (exponentially, unless filtering techniques are employed) with the memory length included in the calculation. We argue that the choice of the (single) trajectory branch during the time preceding the memory interval can significantly affect the memory length required for convergence. At short times, the trajectory branch associated with the reactant state improves convergence by eliminating spurious memory. We also introduce an instantaneous population-based probabilistic scheme which introduces state-to-state hops in the retained pre-memory trajectory branch, and which is designed to choose primarily the trajectory branch associated with the reactant at early times, but to favor the product state more as the reaction progresses to completion. Test calculations show that the dynamically consistent state hopping scheme leads to accelerated convergence and a dramatic reduction of computational effort.},

Potential applications of DeePMD-kit span from finite molecules to extended systems and from metallic systems to chemically bonded systems. DeePMD-kit is interfaced with TensorFlow, one of the most popular deep learning frameworks, making the training process highly automatic and efficient. On the other end, DeePMD-kit is interfaced with high-performance classical molecular dynamics and quantum (path-integral) molecular dynamics packages, i.e., LAMMPS and the i-PI, respectively. Thus, upon training, the potential energy and force field models can be used to perform efficient molecular simulations for different purposes. As an example of the many potential applications of the package, we use DeePMD-kit to learn the interatomic potential energy and forces of a water model using data obtained from density functional theory. We demonstrate that the resulted molecular dynamics model reproduces accurately the structural information contained in the original model.

This phenomenon enables the compensation for losses in dissipative systems and opens a wide range of applications in quantum optics, plasmonics, and optoelectronics, where the loss is inevitable but can be compensated by the gain.},

For decades this singularity had been numerically removed by regularizing the reduced density matrix. In this Perspective we discuss our recent proposal to regularize the coefficient tensor instead, which has significant impact on both the efficiency and correctness of the EOMs in MCTDH and ML-MCTDH for challenging problems. We further demonstrate that when the system becomes large such that it is necessary to use ML-MCTDH with many layers, it is much more important to employ this new regularization scheme. We illustrate this point by studying a spin--boson model with a large bath that contains up to 100\,000 modes. We show that even in the weak coupling regime the new regularization scheme is required to quickly rotate the virtual orbitals into the correct directions in Hilbert space. We argue that this situation can be common for applying a time-dependent tensor network approach to any large enough system.},

In fact, it is so popular that the question is rarely asked whether it is fit for purpose. In this paper, we argue that, whilst the LJ potential was designed for noble gases such as argon, it is often used for systems where it is not expected to be particularly realistic. Under those circumstances, the disadvantages of the LJ potential become relevant: most important among these is that in simulations the LJ potential is always modified such that it has a finite range. More seriously, there is by now a whole family of different potentials that are all called Lennard-Jones 12-6, and that are all different -- and that may have very different macroscopic properties. In this paper, we consider alternatives to the LJ 12-6 potential that could be employed under conditions where the LJ potential is only used as a typical short-ranged potential with attraction. We construct a class of potentials that are, in many respects LJ-like but that are by construction finite ranged, vanishing quadratically at the cut-off distance, and that are designed to be computationally cheap. Below, we present this potential and report numerical data for its thermodynamic and transport properties, for the most important cases (cut-off distance rc = 2{$\sigma$} (``LJ-like'') and rc = 1.2{$\sigma$} (a typical ``colloidal'' potential)).},

Here, we generalize quantum-electrodynamical density functional theory to account for dissipative dynamics of the cavity and describe coupled cavity--single molecule interactions in the weak-to-strong-coupling regimes. Specifically, to establish this generalized technique, we study excited-state dynamics and spectral responses of benzene and toluene under weak-to-strong light--matter coupling. By tuning the coupling, we achieve cavity-mediated energy transfer between electronically excited states. This generalized ab initio quantum-electrodynamical density functional theory treatment can be naturally extended to describe cavity-mediated interactions in arbitrary electromagnetic environments, accessing correlated light--matter observables and thereby closing the gap between electronic structure theory, quantum optics, and nanophotonics.},

The Dirac--Frenkel variational principle is then applied to optimally determine the equations of motion. Following this strategy, the SP groups are built in several layers, where each top layer SP can contain many more Cartesian degrees of freedom than in the previous formulation of the MCTDH method. As a result, the ML-MCTDH method has the capability of treating substantially more physical degrees of freedom than the original MCTDH method, and thus significantly enhances the ability of carrying out quantum dynamical simulations for complex molecular systems. The efficiency of the new formulation is demonstrated by converged quantum dynamical simulations for systems with a few hundred to a thousand degrees of freedom.},

In addition to the above, we consider a number of applications of NEGF, not in routine model system calculations, but in a few new aspects showing the power and usefulness of the formalism. In particular, we discuss the problems of multiple leads, coupled left-right-lead system, and system without a center. We also apply the method to the problem of full counting statistics.

While full QCPI calculations have been shown to be feasible on parallel computing platforms, the large number of trajectory calculations required leads to computational cost that significantly exceeds that of classical molecular dynamics calculations. This paper describes the harmonic back-reaction (HBR) approximation to the QCPI expression, which reduces dramatically the computational cost by requiring a single classical trajectory from each initial condition. Test calculations on a model of strongly anharmonic oscillators show that the HBR treatment quantitatively reproduces the full QCPI results. The HBR-QCPI algorithm is applicable to a variety of condensed phase and biological systems with effort only somewhat greater than that of molecular dynamics simulations.},

Significant progress has been made recently to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the surface hopping technique. Various limitations of the standard FSSH---associated with quantum nuclear effects, interference and decoherence, trivial or ``unavoided'' crossings, superexchange, and representation dependence---have been lifted. These advances are needed to allow one to treat many important phenomena in chemistry, physics, materials, and related disciplines. Examples include charge transport in extended systems such as organic solids, singlet fission in molecular aggregates, Auger-type exciton multiplication, recombination and relaxation in quantum dots and other nanoscale materials, Auger-assisted charge transfer, nonradiative luminescence quenching, and electron--hole recombination. This Perspective summarizes recent advances in the surface hopping formulation of nonadiabatic dynamics and provides an outlook on the future of surface hopping.},

  abstract = {Abstract The review describes recent method developments toward application of the trajectory surface hopping approach for nonadiabatic dynamics simulations of extended systems. Due to the ease of implementation and good balance between efficiency and reliability, surface hopping has become one of the most widely used mixed quantum-classical methods for studying general charge and exciton dynamics. In extended systems (e.g., aggregates, polymers, surfaces, interfaces, and solids), however, surface hopping suffers from the difficulty to treat complex surface crossings in the adiabatic representation, and thus the relevant applications have been limited in the past years. The latest studies have allowed us to make a systematic classification of the surface crossings and identify their different influence mechanisms on the traditional surface hopping machinery, including problems related to the phase uncertainty correction of adiabatic states, the wave function propagation, the calculation of hopping probabilities, the velocity adjustment after surface hops, and the artificial long-range population transfer amplified by decoherence corrections. Elegant solutions to each of these problems have enabled us to get fast time step convergence and size independence even for very large systems with different strengths of electron?phonon couplings. Thereby, the recent theoretical progresses have opened the door to simulate the real-time and real-space dynamics (e.g., charge separation, recombination, relaxation, and diffusion) in realistic extended systems, and will generate comprehensive understanding to promote the development of many research fields in chemistry, physics, biology, and material sciences in the near future.

We combine the thawed Gaussian approximation (TGA) with an on-the-fly ab initio (OTF-AI) scheme to calculate the vibrationally resolved emission spectra of oligothiophenes with up to five rings. The efficiency of the OTF-AI-TGA permits treating all vibrational degrees of freedom on an equal footing even in pentathiophene with 105 vibrational degrees of freedom, thus obviating the need for the global harmonic approximation, popular for large systems. Besides reproducing almost perfectly the experimental emission spectra, in order to provide a deeper insight into the associated physical and chemical processes, we also develop a novel systematic approach to assess the importance and coupling between individual vibrational degrees of freedom during the dynamics. This allows us to explain how the vibrational line shapes of the oligothiophenes change with increasing number of rings. Furthermore, we observe the dynamical interplay between the quinoid and aromatic characters of individual rings in the oligothiophene chain during the dynamics and confirm that the quinoid character prevails in the center of the chain.},

On the other hand, a recently derived semiclassical formula for the coherent state propagator involves a path that is determined in exactly the same manner as the extremal paths of the conventional path integrals. Since both the semiclassical and the stationary phase analyses yield asymptotic (h(cross) to 0) approximations, the stationary phase and the semiclassical expressions for the propagator should be identical. The author presents a simple and direct proof that, in spite of the apparent differences, this is indeed the case. The simplification in the semiclassical formula is due to the utilisation of an appropriate set of canonical variables to describe the classical dynamics. In order to illustrate the usefulness of the semiclassical formula they present an application to the problem of the degenerate parametric amplifier, which had been treated before by operator ordering and path integral methods. The semiclassical approach has a simple classical interpretation that is absent in the alternative treatments.},

It is found that the competition between the intramolecular vibronic coupling ({$\lambda$}) and the intermolecular exciton coupling (J) governs the crystalline aggregate spectral characters. At room temperature, when J/{$\lambda$} value is larger than a critical value (ca. 0.17), the exciton coupling would have a large effect on the optical spectra. For face-to-face H-aggregates, only when both intermolecular electrostatic and excitonic couplings are considered, can one obtain calculated vibrationally resolved spectra and well reproduce the experimental results, namely, remarkable blue-shift in absorption but much less red-shift in emission when compared with the gas-phase. The optical spectra of the AIE-active aggregates are determined by the intramolecular vibronic coupling because the ratio J/{$\lambda$} is less than the critical value.},

Here we present a novel method, based on a semi-classical approximation, that is as efficient as the commonly used mean field Ehrenfest or ad hoc surface hopping methods and properly accounts for interference and decoherence effects. This novel method is an extension of Heller's thawed Gaussian wave-packet dynamics that includes coupling between potential energy surfaces. By studying several standard test problems we demonstrate that the accuracy of the method can be systematically improved while maintaining high efficiency.

Methods for the simulation of non-adiabatic dynamics are typically either numerically impractical, highly complex, or based on approximations which can result in failure for even simple systems. Recently, the Semiclassical Monte Carlo (SCMC) approach was developed in an attempt to combine the accuracy of rigorous semiclassical methods with the efficiency and simplicity of widely used surface hopping methods. However, while SCMC was found to be more efficient than other semiclassical methods, it is not yet as efficient as is needed to be used for large molecular systems. Here, we have developed two new methods: the accelerated-SCMC and the accelerated-SCMC with re-Gaussianization, which reduce the cost of the SCMC algorithm up to two orders of magnitude for certain systems. In most cases shown here, the new procedures are nearly as efficient as the commonly used surface hopping schemes, with little to no loss of accuracy. This implies that these modified SCMC algorithms will be of practical numerical solutions for simulating non-adiabatic dynamics in realistic molecular systems.},

Many dynamical phenomena, such as intersystem crossing, non-radiative relaxation, and charge and energy transfer, require a non-adiabatic description which incorporate transitions between electronic states. Additionally, these dynamics are often highly sensitive to quantum coherences and interference effects. Several methods exist to simulate non-adiabatic dynamics; however, they are typically either too expensive to be applied to large molecular systems (10's-100's of atoms), or they are based on ad hoc schemes which may include severe approximations due to inconsistencies in classical and quantum mechanics. We present, in detail, an algorithm based on Monte Carlo sampling of the semiclassical time-dependent wavefunction that involves running simple surface hopping dynamics, followed by a post-processing step which adds little cost. The method requires only a few quantities from quantum chemistry calculations, can systematically be improved, and provides excellent agreement with exact quantum mechanical results. Here we show excellent agreement with exact solutions for scattering results of standard test problems. Additionally, we find that convergence of the wavefunction is controlled by complex valued phase factors, the size of the non-adiabatic coupling region, and the choice of sampling function. These results help in determining the range of applicability of the method, and provide a starting point for further improvement.},

We provide an overview of new features added since the initial publication [Wiecha, Comput. Phys. Commun. 233 (2018) 167--192]. The updated version of pyGDM is implemented in pure python, removing the former dependency on fortran-based binaries. In the course of this re-write, the toolkit's internal architecture has been completely redesigned to offer a much wider range of possibilities to the user such as the choice of the dyadic Green's functions describing the environment. A new class of dyads allows to perform 2D simulations of infinitely long nanostructures. While the Green's dyads in pyGDM are based on a quasistatic description for interfaces, we also provide as new external python package ``pyGDM2\_retard'' a module with retarded Green's tensors for an environment with two interfaces. We have furthermore added functionalities for simulations using fast-electron excitation, namely electron energy loss spectroscopy and cathodoluminescence. Along with several further new tools and improvements, the update includes also the possibility to calculate the magnetic field and the magnetic LDOS inside nanostructures, field-gradients in- and outside a nanoparticle, optical forces or the chirality of nearfields.

We also show that the direction of the scaling of the tunnel splitting changes sign when the bare splitting crosses {\textohm}. We find good agreement between our analytical approximations and numerical results.

Our exact results are then compared to calculations using the incoherent F{\"o}rster theory, and it is found that the time scale of energy transfer is roughly the same, regardless of whether or not coherence is considered. This means that coherence is not likely to improve the efficiency of the transfer. In fact, the incoherent theory often tends to overpredict the rates of energy transfer, suggesting that, in some cases, quantum coherence may actually slow the photosynthetic process.},

  abstract = {Femtosecond transient grating and photon echo spectroscopies with a sub-20 fs time resolution are applied to allophycocyanin (APC), a protein located at the base of the phycobilisome antenna of cyanobacteria. Coupling between pairs of phycocyanobilin pigments with nondegenerate energy levels gives rise to the four-level exciton electronic structure of APC. Spectroscopic signals obtained in multiple experiments (e.g., linear absorption, fluorescence, transient grating, 2D Fourier transform photon echo) are used to constrain the parameters of a Frenkel exciton Hamiltonian. Comparison between experiment and theory yields a robust microscopic understanding of the electronic and nuclear relaxation dynamics. In agreement with previous work, transient absorption anisotropy establishes that internal conversion between the exciton states of the dimer occurs with time constants of 35, 220, and 280 fs. The sub-100 fs dynamics are decomposed into three distinct relaxation processes: electronic population transfer, intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution, and the dephasing of electronic and nuclear coherences. Model calculations show that the sub-100 fs red-shift in the transient absorption signal spectrum reflects interference between stimulated emission (ESE) and excited state absorption (ESA) signal components. It is also established that the pigment fluctuations in the dimer are not well-correlated, although further experiments will be required to precisely quantify the amount of correlation. The findings of this paper suggest that the light harvesting function of APC is enhanced by nondegeneracy of the pigments comprising the dimer and strong vibronic coupling of intramolecular modes on the phycocyanobilins. We find that the exciton states are 96\% localized to the individual molecular sites within a particular dimer. Localization of the transition densities, in turn, is suggested to promote significant vibronic coupling which serves to both broaden the absorption line shape and open channels for fast internal conversion. The dominant internal conversion channel is assigned to a promoting mode near 800 cm-1 involving hydrogen out-of-plane (HOOP) wagging motion similar to that observed in phytochrome and retinal. This rate enhancement ensures that all photoexcitations quickly and efficiently relax to the electronic origin of the lower energy exciton state from which energy transfer to the reaction center occurs.},

This paper obtains new experimental evidence suggesting that electronic relaxation proceeds by way of incoherent energy transfer between the {$\alpha$}84 and {$\beta$}84 pigment sites (i.e., the weak coupling limit of energy transfer). Transient absorption anisotropies simulated in the weak coupling limit agree well with measurements, whereas signals computed in an exciton basis possess short-lived (electronic) coherent components not present in the experimental data. In addition, 2D photon echo spectra for CPC show no sign of the interfering nonlinearities predicted by a theoretical model to be characteristic of exciton formation. Another important new observation is that the sub-100 fs dynamics in the transient absorption anisotropy are dominated by an impulsively excited hydrogen out-of-plane wagging mode similar to those observed in phytochrome and retinal. Detection of this 795 cm-1 coherence is of particular interest because our recent study of a closely related protein, Allophycocyanin (APC), assigns a similar coordinate as a promoting mode enabling ultrafast internal conversion. Together, the experiments conducted for APC and CPC suggest that interactions between the pigments and environment are the key to understanding why electronic relaxation in CPC is more than three times slower than APC despite the nearly identical geometries of the pigment dimers. Most important in reaching this conclusion is the present finding that relaxation of the 2D photon echo line shapes of CPC is approximately two times faster than that measured for APC. Overall, the present results underscore the ability of phycobiliproteins to control light harvesting dynamics through solvation and variation in the conformations of open-chain tetrapyrrole chromophores.},

  abstract = {Femtosecond laser spectroscopies are used to investigate the influence of intramolecular nuclear modes on electronic relaxation in the cyanobacterial light harvesting protein, C-phycocyanin (CPC). Of particular interest are sub-ps dynamics localized on pairs of closely spaced phycocyanobilin pigments (i.e. dimers). Experiments conducted under different polarization conditions are used to distinguish isotropic and anisotropic vibrational modes within the dimers. Two isotropic nuclear modes are detected near 185 and 260~cm-1~using two-dimensional photon echo spectroscopy. In addition, a transient absorption anisotropy measurement reveals vibrational resonances associated with (out-of-plane) anisotropic nuclear modes near 640 and 815~cm-1. We investigate two possible origins for the recurrences in the anisotropy. A mechanism involving ground state nuclear coherences in the Condon approximation is ruled out by comparing the potential energy surfaces of the excitons to the direction of wavepacket motion. Electronic structure calculations suggest that non-Condon effects are the most likely explanation for the beats observed in the anisotropy. Such non-Condon effects also hold interesting implications for the vibronic exciton electronic structure of CPC. We calculate non-Condon intermolecular couplings in the dimer as large as 10~cm-1, which suggests that these effects are not negligible and deserve further consideration. Our findings provide additional insights into the sub-100 fs vibronic relaxation channel found in the closely related protein, allophycocyanin, whose pigment dimers possess nearly the same geometry and intermolecular Coulombic interactions as CPC. This study underscores the complex interplay of intramolecular vibronic coupling and site energy tuning in photosynthetic light harvesting.},

  abstract = {Transport processes and spectroscopic phenomena in light harvesting proteins depend sensitively on the characteristics of electron-phonon couplings. Decoherence imposed by low-frequency nuclear motion generally suppresses the delocalization of electronic states, whereas the Franck-Condon progressions of high-frequency intramolecular modes underpin a hierarchy of vibronic Coulombic interactions between pigments. This Article investigates the impact of vibronic couplings on the electronic structures and relaxation mechanisms of two cyanobacterial light-harvesting proteins, allophycocyanin (APC) and C-phycocyanin (CPC). Both APC and CPC possess three pairs of pigments (i.e., dimers) that undergo electronic relaxation on the subpicosecond time scale. Electronic relaxation is {$\sim$}10 times faster in APC than in CPC despite the nearly identical structures of their pigment dimers. We suggest that the distinct behaviors of these closely related proteins are understood on the same footing only in a basis of joint electronic-nuclear states (i.e., vibronic excitons). A vibronic exciton model predicts well-defined rate enhancements in APC at realistic values of the site reorganization energies, whereas a purely electronic exciton model points to faster dynamics in CPC. Calculated exciton sizes (i.e., participation ratios) show that wave function delocalization underlies the rate enhancement predicted by the vibronic exciton model. Strong vibronic coupling and heterogeneity in the pigment sites are the key ingredients of the vibronic delocalization mechanism. In contrast, commonly employed purely electronic exciton models see heterogeneity as only a localizing influence. This work raises the possibility that similar vibronic effects, which are often neglected, may generally have a significant influence on energy transport in molecular aggregates and photosynthetic complexes.},

In this paper wave packet propagation techniques, using the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree approach, are used to study this problem. The investigation was made in stages so as to study the nature of the wave function needed to correctly describe various properties of this multimode problem: the absorption spectrum; the energy exchange between the system and the bath; and the rate of inter-state crossing. It was found that, despite the relatively weak system--bath coupling, a multiconfigurational wave function was necessary to describe the interaction between the two parts of the problem. While it was not possible to treat the full 24-mode problem with such a wave function, the spectrum for a 14-mode system, which includes all the important bath modes, has been calculated in this way. The results, in agreement with the path integral calculations of Krempl et\hphantom{,}al. [J. Chem. Phys. 100, 926 (1994)], show that the effect of a model bath linearly coupled to the system is to reduce the vibrational structure of the spectrum, so as to produce a broad envelope analogous to that observed experimentally. The details of the spectrum are however different for the two methods. The effect of introducing anharmonicity to the bath was also studied, with the result that this leads to a yet broader spectrum.},

The method allows us to study photoinduced charge transport and electroluminescence processes in realistic devices. First, we investigate the electroluminescence properties of a two-level model with two different treatments of inelastic scatterings. We show the regime where self-consistency between electron and photon is important for correct description of the inelastic scatterings. The method is then applied to model single-molecule junctions based on the density-functional tight-binding approach. The predicted emission spectra are found to be in very good agreement with experimental measurements. For nanostructured materials, the method is further applied to study the photoresponse of a two-dimensional graphene/graphite-C3N4 heterojunction photovoltaic device. The simulations demonstrate clearly the impact of atomistic details on the optoelectronic properties of nanodevices. This work provides a practical theoretical framework that can be applied to model and design realistic nanodevices.},

In this work, we present an efficient nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulation method based on time-dependent density functional tight-binding (TDDFTB) theory. Specifically, the adiabatic electronic structure, an essential NAMD input, is described at the TDDFTB level. The nonadiabatic effects originating from the coupled motions of electrons and nuclei are treated by the trajectory surface hopping algorithm. To improve the computational efficiency, nonadiabatic couplings between excited states within the TDDFTB method are derived and implemented using an analytical approach. Furthermore, the time-dependent nonadiabatic coupling scalars are calculated based on the overlap between molecular orbitals rather than the Slater determinants to speed up the simulations. In addition, the electronic decoherence scheme and a state reassigned unavoided crossings algorithm, which has been implemented in the NEXMD software, are used to improve the accuracy of the simulated dynamics and handle trivial unavoided crossings. Finally, the photoinduced nonadiabatic dynamics of a benzene molecule are simulated to demonstrate our implementation. The results for excited state NAMD simulations of benzene molecule based on TDDFTB method compare well to those obtained with numerically expensive time-dependent density functional theory. The proposed methodology provides an attractive theoretical simulation tool for predicting the photophysical and photochemical properties of complex materials.},

This indicates that there are strong and complicated interactions between electronic states and vibration modes in realistic chemical systems. Therefore, simulations of quantum dynamics with a large number of electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom are highly desirable. Due to the efficient compression and localized representation of quantum states in the matrix-product state (MPS) formulation, time-evolution methods based on the MPS framework, which we summarily refer to as tDMRG (time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group) methods, are considered to be promising candidates to study the quantum dynamics of realistic chemical systems. In this work, we benchmark the performances of four different tDMRG methods, including global Taylor, global Krylov, and local one-site and two-site time-dependent variational principles (1TDVP and 2TDVP), with a comparison to multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree and experimental results. Two typical chemical systems of internal conversion and singlet fission are investigated: one containing strong and high-order local and nonlocal electron-vibration couplings and the other exhibiting a continuous phonon bath. The comparison shows that the tDMRG methods (particularly, the 2TDVP method) can describe the full quantum dynamics in large chemical systems accurately and efficiently. Several key parameters in the tDMRG calculation including the truncation error threshold, time interval, and ordering of local sites were also investigated to strike the balance between efficiency and accuracy of results.},

We have developed a globally optimal polarizable water model, OPC3-pol, that explicitly accounts for electronic polarizability with minimal impact on the computational efficiency. OPC3-pol reproduces five key bulk water properties at room temperature with an average relative error of 0.6\%. In atomistic simulations, OPC3-pol's computational efficiency is in between that of 3- and 4-point nonpolarizable models; the model supports increased (4 fs) integration time step. OPC3-pol is tested in simulations of globular protein ubiquitin and a B-DNA dodecamer with several AMBER force fields, ff99SB, ff14SB, ff19SB, and OL15, demonstrating structure stability close to reference on multi-microsecond time scale. Simulation of an intrinsically disordered amyloid {$\beta$}-peptide yields an ensemble with the radius of gyration of a random coil. The proposed water model can be trivially adopted by any package that supports standard nonpolarizable force fields and water models; its intended use is in long classical atomistic simulations where water polarization effects are expected to be important.},

  abstract = {Proper construction of the density matrix based on surface hopping trajectories remains a difficult problem. Due to the well-known overcoherence in traditional surface hopping simulations, the electronic wave function cannot be used directly. In this work, we propose a consistent density matrix construction method, which takes the advantage of occupation of active states to rescale the coherence calculated by wave functions and ensures the intrinsic consistency of the density matrix. This new trajectory analysis method can be used for both Tully's fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) and our recently proposed branching corrected surface hopping (BCSH). As benchmarked in both one- and two-dimensional standard scattering models, the new approach combined with BCSH trajectories achieves highly accurate time-dependent spatial distributions of adiabatic populations and coherence compared to exact quantum results.},

In this review, we introduce several typical scenarios of applying machine learning to energy chemistry, including organic photovoltaics (OPVs), perovskites, catalytic reactions and batteries. In each section, we discuss the most recent and state-of-art progress in descriptors and algorithms, and how these tools assist and benefit the design of materials and devices. Additionally, we provide a perspective on the future direction of research in this field, highlighting the potential of machine learning to accelerate the development of sustainable energy sources.

This concept has been developed into a useful method to treat open quantum systems with a complete range of system-bath coupling strength. Especially, the polaron transformation approach shows its validity in the intermediate coupling regime, in which the Redfield equation or Fermi's golden rule will fail. In the polaron frame, the equilibrium distribution carried out by perturbative expansion presents a deviation from the canonical distribution, which is beyond the usual weak coupling assumption in thermodynamics. A polaron transformed Redfield equation (PTRE) not only reproduces the dissipative quantum dynamics but also provides an accurate and efficient way to calculate the non-equilibrium steady states. Applications of the PTRE approach to problems such as exciton diffusion, heat transport and light-harvesting energy transfer are presented.},

Built on the concept of quantum heat engine, our three-level model describes non-equilibrium quantum processes including light-harvesting energy transfer, nano-scale heat transfer, photo-induced isomerization, and photovoltaics in double quantum-dots. In the context of light-harvesting, the excitation energy is first pumped up by sunlight, then is transferred via two excited states which are coupled to a phonon bath, and finally decays to the reaction center. The efficiency of this process is evaluated by steady state analysis via a polaron-transformed master equation; thus the entire range of the system-phonon coupling strength can be covered. We show that the coupling with the phonon bath not only modifies the steady state, resulting in population inversion, but also introduces a finite steady state coherence which optimizes the energy transfer flux and efficiency. In the strong coupling limit, the steady state coherence disappears and the efficiency recovers the heat engine limit given by Scovil and Schultz-Dubois (1959 Phys. Rev. Lett. 2 262).},

In this work, we propose a stochastic adaptive single-site TDVP (SA-1TDVP) scheme to evolve the bond-dimension adaptively, which can integrate the traditional advantages of both the high efficiency of the single-site TDVP (1TDVP) variant and the high accuracy of the two-site TDVP (2TDVP) variant. Based on the assumption that the level statistics of entanglement Hamiltonians, which originate from the reduced density matrices of the MPS method, follows a Poisson or Wigner distribution, as generically predicted by random-matrix theory, additional random singular values are generated to expand the bond-dimension automatically. Tests on simulating the vibrationally resolved quantum dynamics and absorption spectra in the pyrazine molecule and perylene bisimide (PBI) J-aggregate trimer as well as a spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain show that it can be automatic and as accurate as 2TDVP but reduce the computational time remarkably.},

This leads to an elegant extension of the HEOM to arbitrary temperatures and very general reservoirs in combination with efficiency, high accuracy, and long-time stability. Moreover, the technique can directly be implemented in other approaches such as Green's function, stochastic, and pseudomode formulations. As one highly nontrivial application, for the subohmic spin-boson model at vanishing temperature the Shiba relation is quantitatively verified which predicts the long-time decay of correlation functions.},

H2O2 readily forms clusters with water molecules. In the present study, the reactions of ionized H2O2--water clusters, H2O2+(H2O)n, after vertical ionization of the parent neutral cluster were investigated using the direct ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) method to elucidate the reaction mechanism. Clusters with one to five water molecules, H2O2--(H2O)n (n = 1--5), were examined, and the reaction of [H2O2+(H2O)n]ver was tracked from the vertical ionization point to the product state, where [H2O2+(H2O)n]ver is the vertical ionization state (hole is localized on H2O2). After ionization, fast proton transfer (PT) from H2O2+ to the water cluster (H2O)n was observed in all clusters. The HOO radical and H3O+(H2O)n-1 were formed as products. The PT reaction proceeds directly without an activation barrier. The PT times for n = 1--5 were calculated to be 36.0, 9.8, 8.3, 7.7, and 7.1 fs, respectively, at the MP2/6-311++G(d,p) level, indicating that PT in these clusters is a very fast process, and the PT time is not dependent on the cluster size (n), except in the case of n = 1, where the PT time was slightly longer because the bond distance and angle of the hydrogen bond in n = 1 were deformed from the standard structure. The reaction mechanism was discussed based on these results.},

This newly developed theory treats not only the quantum dissipative systems of primary interest, but also the hybrid environment dynamics that are also experimentally measurable. Despite the fact that DEOM recovers the celebrated hierarchical-equations-of-motion (HEOM) formalism, these two approaches have some fundamental differences. To show these differences, we also scrutinize the HEOM construction via its root at the influence functional path integral formalism. We conclude that many unique features of DEOM are beyond the reach of the HEOM framework. The new DEOM approach renders a statistical quasi-particle picture to account for the environment, which can be either bosonic or fermionic. The review covers the DEOM construction, the physical meanings of dynamical variables, the underlying theorems and dissipaton algebra, and recent numerical advancements for efficient DEOM evaluations of various problems. We also address the issue of high-order many-dissipaton truncations with respect to the invariance principle of quantum mechanics of Schr{\"o}dinger versus Heisenberg prescriptions. DEOM serves as a universal tool for characterizing of stationary and dynamic properties of system-and-bath interferences, as highlighted with its real-time evaluation of both linear and nonlinear current noise spectra of nonequilibrium electronic transport.},

  abstract = {The question of how quantum coherence facilitates energy transfer has been intensively debated in the scientific community. Since natural and artificial light-harvesting units operate under the stationary condition, we address this question via a nonequilibrium steady-state analysis of a molecular dimer irradiated by incoherent sunlight and then generalize the key predictions to arbitrarily complex exciton networks. The central result of the steady-state analysis is the coherence--flux--efficiency relation: {$\eta$} = c{$\sum$}i{$\neq$}jFij{$\kappa$}j = 2c{$\sum$}i{$\neq$}jJijIm[{$\rho$}ij]{$\kappa$}j, where c is the normalization constant. In this relation, the first equality indicates that the energy transfer efficiency, {$\eta$}, is uniquely determined by the trapping flux, which is the product of the flux, F, and branching ratio, {$\kappa$}, for trapping at the reaction centers, and the second equality indicates that the energy transfer flux, F, is equivalent to the quantum coherence measured by the imaginary part of the off-diagonal density matrix, that is, Fij = 2JijIm[{$\rho$}ij]. Consequently, maximal steady-state coherence gives rise to optimal efficiency. The coherence--flux--efficiency relation holds rigorously and generally for any exciton network of arbitrary connectivity under the stationary condition and is not limited to incoherent radiation or incoherent pumping. For light-harvesting systems under incoherent light, the nonequilibrium energy transfer flux (i.e., steady-state coherence) is driven by the breakdown of detailed balance and by the quantum interference of light excitations and leads to the optimization of energy transfer efficiency. It should be noted that the steady-state coherence or, equivalently, efficiency is the combined result of light-induced transient coherence, inhomogeneous depletion, and the system--bath correlation and is thus not necessarily correlated with quantum beatings. These findings are generally applicable to quantum networks and have implications for quantum optics and devices.},

Among the many Monte Carlo methods applicable to quantum mechanical systems, the path integral Monte Carlo approach with its variants has been employed widely. Since semi-classical or classical approaches will not be discussed in this review, path integral based approaches can for our purposes be divided into two categories: approaches applicable to quantum mechanical systems at zero temperature and approaches applicable to quantum mechanical systems at finite temperature. While these two approaches are related to each other, the underlying formulation and aspects of the algorithm differ. This paper reviews the path integral Monte Carlo ground state (PIGS) approach, which solves the time-independent Schr{\"o}dinger equation. Specifically, the PIGS approach allows for the determination of expectation values with respect to eigen states of the few- or many-body Schr{\"o}dinger equation provided the system Hamiltonian is known. The theoretical framework behind the PIGS algorithm, implementation details, and sample applications for fermionic systems are presented.},

There are several theoretical prescriptions of quantum dissipation but none of them is simple enough to be treated exactly in real applications. As a result, formulations in different prescriptions are practically used with different approximation schemes. This review examines both theoretical and application aspects on various perturbative formulations, especially those that are exact up to second-order but nonequivalent in high-order system-bath coupling contributions. Discrimination is made in favor of an unconventional formulation that in a sense combines the merits of both the conventional time-local and memory-kernel prescriptions, where the latter is least favorite in terms of the applicability range of parameters for system-bath coupling, non-Markovian, and temperature. Also highlighted is the importance of correlated driving and disspation effects, not only on the dynamics under strong external field driving, but also in the calculation of field-free correlation and response functions.},

The present theoretical formalism offers efficient and accurate means for the study of steady-state (nonequilibrium and equilibrium) and real-time dynamical properties of both systems and hybridizing environments. It further provides universal evaluations, exact in principle, on various correlation functions, including even those of environmental degrees of freedom in coupling with systems.

The HEOM-QUICK program implements the formally exact HEOM formalism for fermionic open systems. Its simulation results capture the combined effects of system-environment dissipation, many-body interactions, and non-Markovian memory in a nonperturbative manner. The HEOM-QUICK program has been employed to explore a wide range of static and dynamic properties of various types of quantum impurity systems, including charge or spin qubits, quantum dots, molecular junctions, and so on. It has also been utilized in conjunction with first-principles methods such as density-functional theory methods to study the correlated electronic structure of adsorbed magnetic molecules.

Inhibition of Notum carries therapeutic effects against a number of maladies including osteoporosis, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. Recently, a class of irreversible inhibitors based on esters of 4-(indolin-1-yl)-4-oxobutanoic acid have been reported. Using the crystal structures of enzyme-4-(indolin-1-yl)-4-oxobutanoate adduct and 4-(indolin-1-yl)-4-oxobutanoic acid-enzyme complex, we studied computationally the proposed inhibition mechanism using model systems based on the own n-layered integrated molecular orbital and molecular mechanics (ONIOM) method. In the first place, model systems were formulated to investigate the transesterification between the catalytic serine residue, Ser-232, and the methyl ester of 4-(indolin-1-yl)-4-oxobutanoate. In the second place, the hydrolysis mechanism of the resultant enzyme--inhibitor adduct was studied. The energetics of these steps were analyzed using a density functional theory functional in the ONIOM method. In addition, the roles of active-site residues during these steps were highlighted. It was found that the hydrolysis of the covalent adduct is highly endergonic corroborating the irreversible inhibition mechanism. These results will shed light not only on the inhibition mechanism but also on the catalytic mechanism.},

  abstract = {We present numerically exact quantum dynamics simulations using the hierarchical equation of motion approach to investigate the resonance enhancement of chemical reactions due to the vibrational strong coupling (VSC) in polariton chemistry. The results reveal that the cavity mode acts like a ``rate-promoting vibrational mode'' that enhances the ground state chemical reaction rate constant when the cavity mode frequency matches the vibrational transition frequency. The exact simulation predicts that the VSC-modified rate constant will change quadratically as the light--matter coupling strength increases. When changing the cavity lifetime from the lossy limit to the lossless limit, the numerically exact results predict that there will be a turnover of the rate constant. Based on the numerical observations, we present an analytic rate theory to explain the observed sharp resonance peak of the rate profile when tuning the cavity frequency to match the quantum transition frequency of the vibrational ground state to excited states. This rate theory further explains the origin of the broadening of the rate profile. The analytic rate theory agrees with the numerical results under the golden rule limit and the short cavity lifetime limit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analytic theory that is able to explain the sharp resonance behavior of the VSC-modified rate profile when coupling an adiabatic ground state chemical reaction to the cavity. We envision that both the numerical analysis and the analytic theory will offer invaluable theoretical insights into the fundamental mechanism of the VSC-induced rate constant modifications in polariton chemistry.},

Qualitative models were proposed to predict the preferential diastereomer and its twist, and computational studies provided a rationalization of the CD spectra. Different ECCD spectra found for diastereomers formed in the self-assembled tris(pyridine) complexes were used to determine the absolute configurations of chiral mono-ols. Linear discriminant analysis was successfully employed to classify the alcohol analytes, thereby allowing identification of the alcohols. Conformational effects imparted by heteroatoms were also explored, further expanding the substrate scope. Finally, ee calibration curves allowed the determination of the ee of unknown samples of three chiral secondary alcohols with an average error of 3\%. The assay described here is unique because no preparation of structurally elaborated chiral hosts is needed.},

We observe that manipulating the light-matter coupling strength and cavity frequencies can either inhibit or accelerate the dissociation rate. Furthermore, we discover that the cavity surprisingly modifies the vibrational dissociation channels, with a pathway involving both water fragments in their ground vibrational states becoming the major channel, which is a minor one when the water dimer is outside the cavity. We elucidate the mechanisms behind these effects by investigating the critical role of the optical cavity in modifying the intramolecular and intermolecular coupling patterns. While our work focuses on single water dimer system, it provides direct and statistically significant evidence of VSC effects on molecular reaction dynamics.},

The development of such high-level potentials enables efficient and accurate simulations of water systems using classical and quantum dynamical approaches. This Perspective serves as a status report of these potentials, focusing on their methodology and applications to water systems across different phases. Their performances on the energies of gas phase water clusters, as well as condensed phase structural and dynamical properties, are discussed.},

  abstract = {We introduce a numerical algorithm to simulate the time evolution of a matrix product state under a long-ranged Hamiltonian in moderately entangled systems. In the effectively one-dimensional representation of a system by matrix product states, long-ranged interactions are necessary to simulate not just many physical interactions but also higher-dimensional problems with short-ranged interactions. Since our method overcomes the restriction to short-ranged Hamiltonians of most existing methods, it proves particularly useful for studying the dynamics of both power-law interacting, one-dimensional systems, such as Coulombic and dipolar systems, and quasi-two-dimensional systems, such as strips or cylinders. First, we benchmark the method by verifying a long-standing theoretical prediction for the dynamical correlation functions of the Haldane-Shastry model. Second, we simulate the time evolution of an expanding cloud of particles in the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, a subject of several recent experiments.},

  abstract = {A procedure is described for unbiased identification of all {$\pi$}-electron chromophore pair geometry choices that locally maximize the rate of conversion of a singlet exciton into a singlet biexciton (triplet pair), using a simplified version of the diabatic frontier orbital model of singlet fission (SF). The resulting approximate optimal geometries provide insight and are expected to represent useful starting points for searches by more advanced methods. The general procedure is illustrated on a pair of ethylenes as the simplest model of a {$\pi$}-electron system, but it is applicable to pairs of much larger molecules, with dozens of non-hydrogen atoms, and not necessarily planar. We first examine the value of {\textbar}TA{\textbar}2, the square of the electronic matrix element for SF with initial excitation fully localized on partner A, on a grid of several billion geometries within the six-dimensional space of physically realizable possibilities. Several of the optimized pair geometries are somewhat unexpected, but all are found to follow the qualitative guidance proposed earlier. In the neighborhood of each local maximum of {\textbar}TA{\textbar}2, consideration of mixing with charge-transfer configurations and of excitonic interaction between partners A and B determines the SF energy balance and yields squared matrix elements {\textbar}T*{\textbar}2 and {\textbar}T**{\textbar}2 for the lower and upper excitonic states S* and S**, respectively. Assuming Boltzmann populations of these states, the geometry is further optimized to maximize k, the sum of the SF rates obtained from Marcus theory, and this reorders the suitable geometries substantially. At 87 pair geometries, the {\textbar}T*{\textbar}2 and {\textbar}T**{\textbar}2 values are compared with those obtained from high-level ab initio nonorthogonal configuration interaction calculations and found to follow the same trend. Finally, the biexciton binding energy at the optimized geometries is calculated. Altogether, 13 significant local maxima of SF rate for a pair of ethylenes are identified in the physically relevant part of space that avoids molecular interpenetration in the hard-sphere approximation. The three best geometries are twist-stacked, slip-stacked, and L-shaped. The maxima occur at the (five-dimensional) surfaces of seven six-dimensional ``parent'' regions of space centered at physically inaccessible geometries at which the calculated SF rate is very large but the two ethylenes interpenetrate. The results are displayed in interactive graphics. The computer code (``Simple'') written for these calculations is flexible in that it permits a choice of performing the search for local maxima in six dimensions on {\textbar}TA{\textbar}2, {\textbar}T*{\textbar}2, or k.

In this work, a neural network-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is carried out to simulate the benchmark combustion of methane. During MD simulation, detailed reaction processes leading to the creation of specific molecular species including various intermediate radicals and the products are intimately revealed and characterized. Overall, a total of 798 different chemical reactions were recorded and some new chemical reaction pathways were discovered. We believe that the present work heralds the dawn of a new era in which neural network-based reactive MD simulation can be practically applied to simulating important complex reaction systems at ab initio level, which provides atomic-level understanding of chemical reaction processes as well as discovery of new reaction pathways at an unprecedented level of detail beyond what laboratory experiments could accomplish.},

This combined use of non-adiabatic SC-IVR and non-adiabatic path-integral sampling (NA-IVR\&amp;PI) is beyond the treatment of mean-field, and we analyze its performance in comparison with some existing mean-field methods for different scenarios of potential energy surface. We found a systematically better performance. One exception is the deep tunneling regime, where the mean-field ring-polymer instanton is superior. In the golden rule limit, where all these mean-field methods break down, the significant advantage of NA-IVR\&amp;PI is shown by using the electronic states for description of the dividing surface.},

  abstract = {Machine learning models for the potential energy of multi-atomic systems, such as the deep potential (DP) model, make molecular simulations with the accuracy of quantum mechanical density functional theory possible at a cost only moderately higher than that of empirical force fields. However, the majority of these models lack explicit long-range interactions and fail to describe properties that derive from the Coulombic tail of the forces. To overcome this limitation, we extend the DP model by approximating the long-range electrostatic interaction between ions (nuclei + core electrons) and valence electrons with that of distributions of spherical Gaussian charges located at ionic and electronic sites. The latter are rigorously defined in terms of the centers of the maximally localized Wannier distributions, whose dependence on the local atomic environment is modeled accurately by a deep neural network. In the DP long-range (DPLR) model, the electrostatic energy of the Gaussian charge system is added to short-range interactions that are represented as in the standard DP model. The resulting potential energy surface is smooth and possesses analytical forces and virial. Missing effects in the standard DP scheme are recovered, improving on accuracy and predictive power. By including long-range electrostatics, DPLR correctly extrapolates to large systems the potential energy surface learned from quantum mechanical calculations on smaller systems. We illustrate the approach with three examples: the potential energy profile of the water dimer, the free energy of interaction of a water molecule with a liquid water slab, and the phonon dispersion curves of the NaCl crystal.},

  abstract = {One of the central advantages of the Herman Kluk Semiclassical Initial Value Representation (SCIVR) of the quantum propagator is that through its prefactor it approximately conserves unitarity for relatively long times. Its main disadvantage is that the prefactor appearing in the SCIVR propagator is expensive to compute as the dimensionality of the problem increases. When using the SCIVR series method for computation of the numerically exact quantum dynamics, the expense becomes even larger, since each term in the series involves a product of propagators, each with its own prefactor. This expense can be eliminated if one uses prefactor free propagators; however, these do not conserve unitarity as well as the HK propagator. As a compromise, we suggest the use of a hybrid propagator, in which the system variables are treated with the Herman-Kluk prefactor, while the bath variables are treated as prefactor free. Numerical application to a quartic oscillator coupled bilinearly to five harmonic bath oscillators demonstrates the viability of the hybrid method. The results presented are also a first application of the SCIVR series method to a system with six degrees of freedom. Convergence to the numerically exact answer using Monte Carlo sampling is obtained with at most the first two terms in the SCIVR series.},

Electronic structure calculations were performed using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) in both its conventional linear-response (LR) and its spin-flip (SF) formulations. In the SF-TDDFT case, spin contamination in the low-lying singlet states is removed by projecting out the lowest triplet component during iterative solution of the TDDFT eigenvalue problem. The results show that SF-TDDFT qualitatively describes the photoisomerization of trans-C5H6NH2+, with favorable comparison to previous studies using multireference electronic structure methods. In contrast, conventional LR-TDDFT affords qualitatively different photodynamics due to an incorrect excited-state potential surface near the Franck--Condon region. In addition, the photochemistry (involving pre-twisting of the central double bond) appears to be different for SF- and LR-TDDFT, which may be a consequence of different conical intersection topographies afforded by these two methods. The present results contrast with previous surface-hopping studies suggesting that the LR-TDDFT method's incorrect topology around S1/S0 conical intersections is immaterial to the photodynamics.},

Among them, growing efforts have been invested to an intriguing phenomenon, known as the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). Here, we review the recent progress in this emerging field. By starting from the one-dimensional (1D) case, the fundamental concepts of NHSE, its minimal model, the physical meanings and consequences are elaborated in details. In particular, we discuss the NHSE enriched by lattice symmetries, which gives rise to unique non-Hermitian topological properties with revised bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC) and new definitions of topological invariants. Then we extend the discussions to two and higher dimensions, where dimensional surprises enable even more versatile NH.SE phenomena. Extensions of NHSE assisted with extra degrees of freedom such as long-range coupling, pseudospins, magnetism, non-linearity and crystal defects are also reviewed. This is followed by the contemporary experimental progress for NHSE. Finally, we provide the outlooks to possible future directions and developments.},

  abstract = {Quantum transition-state theory (QTST) and free-energy instanton theory (FEIT) are two closely related methods for estimating the quantum rate coefficient from the free-energy at the reaction barrier. In calculations on one-dimensional models, FEIT typically gives closer agreement than QTST with the exact quantum results at all temperatures below the crossover to deep tunneling, suggesting that FEIT is a better approximation than QTST in this regime. Here we show that this simple trend does not hold for systems of greater dimensionality. We report tests on several collinear and three-dimensional reactions, in which QTST outperforms FEIT over a range of temperatures below crossover, which can extend down to half the crossover temperature (below which FEIT outperforms QTST). This suggests that QTST-based methods such as ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) may often give closer agreement with the exact quantum results than FEIT.},

  abstract = {The emergence of {$\Delta$}-learning models, whereby machine learning (ML) is used to predict a correction to a low-level energy calculation, provides a versatile route to accelerate high-level energy evaluations at a given geometry. However, {$\Delta$}-learning models are inapplicable to reaction properties like heats of reaction and activation energies that require both a high-level geometry and energy evaluation. Here, a {$\Delta$}2-learning model is introduced that can predict high-level activation energies based on low-level critical-point geometries. The {$\Delta$}2 model uses an atom-wise featurization typical of contemporary ML interatomic potentials (MLIPs) and is trained on a dataset of {$\sim$}167 000 reactions, using the GFN2-xTB energy and critical-point geometry as a low-level input and the B3LYP-D3/TZVP energy calculated at the B3LYP-D3/TZVP critical point as a high-level target. The excellent performance of the {$\Delta$}2 model on unseen reactions demonstrates the surprising ease with which the model implicitly learns the geometric deviations between the low-level and high-level geometries that condition the activation energy prediction. The transferability of the {$\Delta$}2 model is validated on several external testing sets where it shows near chemical accuracy, illustrating the benefits of combining ML models with readily available physical-based information from semi-empirical quantum chemistry calculations. Fine-tuning of the {$\Delta$}2 model on a small number of Gaussian-4 calculations produced a 35\% accuracy improvement over DFT activation energy predictions while retaining xTB-level cost. The {$\Delta$}2 model approach proves to be an efficient strategy for accelerating chemical reaction characterization with minimal sacrifice in prediction accuracy.},

  abstract = {This Perspective presents an overview of the development of the hierarchy of Davydov's Ans{\"a}tze and a few of their applications in many-body problems in computational chemical physics. Davydov's solitons originated in the investigation of vibrational energy transport in proteins in the 1970s. Momentum-space projection of these solitary waves turned up to be accurate variational ground-state wave functions for the extended Holstein molecular crystal model, lending unambiguous evidence to the absence of formal quantum phase transitions in Holstein systems. The multiple Davydov Ans{\"a}tze have been proposed, with increasing Ansatz multiplicity, as incremental improvements of their single-Ansatz parents. For a given Hamiltonian, the time-dependent variational formalism is utilized to extract accurate dynamic and spectroscopic properties using Davydov's Ans{\"a}tze as its trial states. A quantity proven to disappear for large multiplicities, the Ansatz relative deviation is introduced to quantify how closely the Schr{\"o}dinger equation is obeyed. Three finite-temperature extensions to the time-dependent variation scheme are elaborated, i.e., the Monte Carlo importance sampling, the method of thermofield dynamics, and the method of displaced number states. To demonstrate the versatility of the methodology, this Perspective provides applications of Davydov's Ans{\"a}tze to the generalized Holstein Hamiltonian, variants of the spin-boson model, and systems of cavity-assisted singlet fission, where accurate dynamic and spectroscopic properties of the many-body systems are given by the Davydov trial states.},

The mean prediction errors were within DFT precision, and the results were much better than those obtained using only Mendeleev numbers or a random-element-positioning table, indicating that the two-dimensional inner structure of the periodic table was learned by the CNN as useful chemical information. Transfer learning was then utilized by fine-tuning the weights previously initialized on the OQMD training set. Using compounds with formula X2YZ in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) as a second training set, the stability of full-Heusler compounds was predicted by using the fine-tuned CNN, and tungsten containing compounds were identified as rarely reported but potentially stable compounds.},

The ML-MCTDH result agrees well with the previous simulations using the Redfield theory, the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) and the symmetrical quasi-classical (SQC) theory. We carefully investigated the role of vibrational modes with different frequencies in singlet fission dynamics. Interestingly, we observed the important contribution of a few modes with frequency resonance to electronic transition. Such a finding can be understood by revisiting the superexchange mechanism within the framework of Fermi's golden rule. As a numerically exact method, ML-MCTDH not only provides an accurate description of the microscopy insight of the SF dynamics but also provides benchmark results to examine the performance of other approximated dynamical methods.},

The multichromophoric F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer theory is a popular method to describe the EET process in such systems. This paper presents a new time-domain method for calculating energy transfer based on the combination of multichromophoric F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer theory and the Numerical Integration of the Schr{\"o}dinger Equation method. After validating the method on simple model systems, we apply it to the Light-Harvesting antenna 2 (LH2) complex, a light harvesting antenna found in purple bacteria. We use a simple model combining the overdamped Brownian oscillators to describe the dynamic disorder originating from the environmental fluctuations and the transition charge from the electrostatic potential coupling model to determine the interactions between chromophores. We demonstrate that with this model, both the calculated spectra and the EET rates between the two rings within the LH2 complex agree well with experimental results. We further find that the transfer between the strongly coupled rings of neighboring LH2 complexes can also be well described with our method. We conclude that our new method accurately describes the EET rate for biologically relevant multichromophoric systems, which are similar to the LH2 complex. Computationally, the new method is very tractable, especially for slow processes. We foresee that the method can be applied to efficiently calculate transfer in artificial systems as well and may pave the way for calculating multidimensional spectra of extensive multichromophoric systems in the future.},

As a first step toward a transferable force field for biomolecules entirely derived from ``first-principles'', we introduce a data-driven many-body energy (MB-nrg) potential energy function (PEF) for N-methylacetamide (NMA), a peptide bond capped by two methyl groups that is commonly used as a proxy for the protein backbone. The MB-nrg PEF is shown to accurately describe the energetics and structural properties of an isolated NMA molecule, including the normal modes of both cis and trans isomers and the energy variation along the isomerization path, as well as the multidimensional potential energy landscape of the NMA--H2O dimer in the gas phase. Importantly, we show that the MB-nrg PEF is fully transferable, enabling molecular dynamics simulations of NMA in solution with quantum-mechanical accuracy. Comparisons with results obtained with a popular pairwise-additive force field for biomolecules and a classical polarizable PEF demonstrate the ability of the MB-nrg PEF to accurately represent many-body effects in NMA--H2O interactions at both short and long distances, which is key to guaranteeing full transferability from the gas phase to the liquid phase.},

In particular, we focus on the (i) harmonic and (ii) Gaussian approximations of the PEL, which have been commonly used to describe classical systems, and show how these approximations can be applied to quantum liquids/glasses. Contrary to the case of classical liquids/glasses, the PEL of quantum liquids is temperature-dependent, and hence, the main expressions resulting from approximations (i) and (ii) depend on the nature (classical vs quantum) of the system. The resulting theoretical expressions from the PEL formalism are compared with results from path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations of a monatomic model liquid. In the PIMC simulations, every atom of the quantum liquid is represented by a ring-polymer. Our PIMC simulations show that at the local minima of the PEL (inherent structures, or IS), sampled over a wide range of temperatures and volumes, the ring-polymers are collapsed. This considerably facilitates the description of quantum liquids using the PEL formalism. Specifically, the normal modes of the ring-polymer system/quantum liquid at an IS can be calculated analytically if the normal modes of the classical liquid counterpart are known (as obtained, e.g., from classical MC or molecular dynamics simulations of the corresponding atomic liquid).},

Accurate calculations of the splitting sizes from first principles require a combination of high-quality inter-atomic interactions and rigorous methods to treat the nuclei with quantum mechanics. Many theoretical efforts have been made in recent decades. This Perspective focuses on two path-integral based tunneling splitting methods whose computational cost scales well with the system size, namely, the ring-polymer instanton method and the path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) method. From a simple derivation, we show that the former is a semiclassical approximation to the latter, despite that the two methods are derived very differently. Currently, the PIMD method is considered to be an ideal route to rigorously compute the ground-state tunneling splitting, while the instanton method sacrifices some accuracy for a significantly smaller computational cost. An application scenario of such a quantitatively rigorous calculation is to test and calibrate the potential energy surfaces of molecular systems by spectroscopic accuracy. Recent progress in water clusters is reviewed, and the current challenges are discussed.},

By employing larger 2-body and 3-body training sets, including an explicit machine-learned representation of 4-body energies, and adopting more sophisticated machine-learned representations of 2-body and 3-body energies, we demonstrate that the MB-pol(2023) PEFs achieve sub-chemical accuracy in modeling the energetics of the hexamer isomers, outperforming both the original MB-pol and q-AQUA PEFs, which currently provide the most accurate description of water clusters in the gas phase. Importantly, the MB-pol(2023) PEFs provide remarkable agreement with the experimental results for various properties of liquid water, improving upon the original MB-pol PEF and effectively closing the gap with experimental measurements.},

  abstract = {The Legendre transform is a powerful tool in theoretical physics and plays an important role in classical mechanics, statistical mechanics, and thermodynamics. In typical undergraduate and graduate courses the motivation and elegance of the method are often missing, unlike the treatments frequently enjoyed by Fourier transforms. We review and modify the presentation of Legendre transforms in a way that explicates the formal mathematics, resulting in manifestly symmetric equations, thereby clarifying the structure of the transform. We then discuss examples to motivate the transform as a way of choosing independent variables that are more easily controlled. We demonstrate how the Legendre transform arises naturally from statistical mechanics and show how the use of dimensionless thermodynamic potentials leads to more natural and symmetric relations.},

For the site threshold, which gives the fraction of conducting versus non-conducting spheres necessary for percolation, we find , consistent with the 1979 value of Powell 0.310(5) and identical within errors to the threshold for the simple-cubic lattice, 0.311 608, which shares the same average coordination number of 6. In terms of the volume fraction {$\phi$}, the threshold corresponds to a critical value . For the bond threshold, which apparently was not measured before, we find . To find these thresholds, we considered two shape-dependent universal ratios involving the size of the largest cluster, fluctuations in that size, and the second moment of the size distribution; we confirmed the ratios' universality by also studying the simple-cubic lattice with a similar cubic boundary. The results are applicable to many problems including conductivity in random mixtures, glass formation, and drug loading in pharmaceutical tablets.},

The main tool in this reformulation is the use of projection operators in the Hilbert space of Gibbsian ensemble densities. Projection operators are used to separate an ensemble density into a ``relevant'' part, needed for the calculation of mean values of specified observables, and the remaining ``irrelevant'' part. The relevant part is shown to satisfy a kinetic equation which is a generalization of Van Hove's ``master equation to general order.'' Diagram summation methods are not used. The formalism is illustrated by a new derivation of the Prigogine-Brout master equation for a classical weakly interacting system.},
