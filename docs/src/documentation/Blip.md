# Blip decomposition of the path integral
The blip decomposition of the path integral, as described in [Blip1](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4896736) and [Blip2](https://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4979197), is a different representation of the path integral that significantly reduces the number of "paths" that need to be considered.
